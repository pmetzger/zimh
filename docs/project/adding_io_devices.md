# Adding An I/O Device To A SIMH Virtual Machine

Revision of 17-Mar-2016

This memo provides more detail on adding I/O device simulators to the
various virtual machines supported by SIMH.

# SCP and I/O Device Interactions

## The SCP Interface

The simulator control package (SCP) finds devices through the device
list, `DEVICE *sim_devices`. This list, defined in `<simname>_sys.c`,
must be modified to add the `DEVICE` data structure(s) of the new device
to sim_devices:

```c
extern DEVICE new_device;

/* ... */

DEVICE *sim_devices[] = {
    &cpu_dev,
    /* ... */
    &new_device,
    NULL
};
```

The device then defines data structures for `UNIT`s, `REGISTER`s, and, if
required, options.

## I/O Interface Requirements

SCP provides interfaces to attach files to, and detach them from, I/O
devices, and to examine and modify the contents of attached files. SCP
expects devices to store individual data words right-aligned in
container words. The container words should be the next largest power
of 2 in width:

| Data word  | Container word                            |
|------------|-------------------------------------------|
| 1b to 8b   | 8b                                        |
| 9b to 16b  | 16b                                       |
| 17b to 32b | 32b                                       |
| 33b to 64b | 64b (requires compile flag `-DUSE_INT64`) |

### Save/Restore Interactions

The Save/Restore capability allows simulations to be stopped, saved,
resumed, and repeated. For save and restore to work properly, I/O
devices must save and restore all state required for operation. This
includes control registers, working registers, intermediate buffers,
and mode flags.

Save and restore automatically handle the following state items:

- Content of declared registers.
- Content of memory-like structures.
- Device user-specific flags and `DEV_DIS`.
- Whether each unit is attached to a file and, if so, the file name.
- Whether each unit is active, and, if so, the unit time out.
- Unit `U3`-`U6` words.
- Unit user-specific flags and `UNIT_DIS`.

There are two methods for handling intermediate buffers. First, the
buffer can be made accessible as unit memory. This requires
buffer-specific examine and deposit routines. Alternately, the buffer
can be declared as an arrayed register.

# PDP-8

## CPU and I/O Device Structures

Simulated memory is kept in array `uint16 M[MAXMEMSIZE]`. 12b words
are right justified in each array entry; the high order 4b must be
zero.

The interrupt structure is implemented in three parallel variables:

- `int32 int_req`: interrupt requests. The two high order bits are the
  interrupt enable flag and the interrupts-not-deferred flag
- `int32 dev_done`: device done flags
- `int32 int_enable`: device interrupt enable flags

A device without interrupt control keeps its interrupt request, which
is also the device done flag, in `int_req`. A device with interrupt
control keeps its interrupt request in `dev_done` and its interrupt
enable flag in `int_enable`. Pictorially,

```
    +----+----+…+----+----+…+----+----+----+
    |ion |indf| |irq1|irq2| |irqx|irqy|irqz| irq_req
    +----+----+…+----+----+…+----+----+----+

    +----+----+…+----+----+…+----+----+----+
    | 0  | 0  | | 0  | 0  | |donx|dony|donz| dev_done
    +----+----+…+----+----+…+----+----+----+

    +----+----+…+----+----+…+----+----+----+
    | 0  | 0  | | 0  | 0  | |enbx|enby|enbz| int_enable
    +----+----+…+----+----+…+----+----+----+

    <- fixed -> <-no enbl-> <- with enable->
```

Logically, the relationship is:

```
int_req = (int_req & (OVHD+NOENB)) | (dev_done & dev_enable);
```

Macro `INT_UPDATE` maintains this relationship after a change to any
of the three variables.

Device enable flags are kept in `dev_enb`. The device enable flag, by
convention, is the same bit position as device interrupt flag.

I/O dispatching is done by explicit case decoding in the `IOT`
instruction flow for CPU `IOT`’s, and dispatch through table
`dev_tab[64]` for devices. Each entry in `dev_tab` is a pointer to a
device `IOT` processing routine. The calling sequence for the `IOT`
routine is:

```
new_data = iot_routine (IOT instruction, current AC);
```

where

|                             |                        |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|
| `new_data<11:0>`            | new contents of AC     |
| `new_data<IOT_V_SKP>`       | 1 if skip, 0 if not    |
| `new_data<31:IOT_V_REASON>` | stop code, if non-zero |

## DEVICE Context and Flags

The `DEVICE` `ctxt` (context) field must point to the device information
block (`DIB`), if one exists. The `DEVICE` `flags` field must specify
whether the device supports the `SET ENABLED`/`SET DISABLED` commands
(`DEV_DISABLE`). If a device can be disabled, the state of the device
`flag<DEV_DIS>` must be declared as a register for `SAVE`/`RESTORE`.

## Adding A New I/O Device

### Defining The Device Number and Done/Interrupt Flag

Module `pdp8_defs.h` must be modified to add the device number
definitions and the device interrupt flag definitions. The device
number is the lowest device number that the device responds to (e.g,
`060` for the `RL8A`):

```
#define DEV_NEW        0nn                 /* not 0,010,020-027 */
```

If the device has a separate interrupt enable, the interrupt flag must
be added above `INT_V_DIRECT`, and the latter increased accordingly:

```
#define INT_V_TTI4     (INT_V_START+13)    /* clock */
#define INT_V_NEW      (INT_V_START+14)    /* new */
#define INT_V_DIRECT   (INT_V_START+15)    /* direct start */
/*...*/
#define INT_NEW        (1 << INT_V_NEW)
```

If the device has only an interrupt/done flag, it must be added
between `INT_V_DIRECT` and `INT_V_OVHD`, and the latter increased
accordingly:

```
#define INT_V_UF       (INT_V_DIRECT+8)    /* user int */
#define INT_V_NEW      (INT_V_DIRECT+9)    /* new */
#define INT_V_OVHD     (INT_V_DIRECT+10)   /* overhead start */
/*...*/
#define INT_NEW        (1 << INT_V_NEW)
```

### Adding The Device Information Block

The device information block is declared in the device module, as follows:

```
int32 iotrtn1(int32 instruction, int32 AC);
int32 iotrtn2(int32 instruction, int32 AC);
/* ... */
DIB dev_dib = { DEV_NEW, num_iot_routines, { &iotrtn1, &iotrn2, … } };
```

`DEV_NEW` is the device number, and num_iot_routines is the number of
`IOT` dispatch routines (allocated contiguously starting at
`DEV_NEW`). If a device number in the range defined by \[`DEV_NEW`,
`DEV_NEW + num_iot_routines - 1`\] is not needed, the corresponding
dispatch address should be `NULL`.

# PDP-4/7/9/15

## CPU and I/O Device Structures

Simulated memory is kept in an array `*M`, dynamically allocated. 18b
words are right justified in each array entry; the high order 14b must
be zero.

The interrupt structure is implemented in an array
`int32 int_hwre[5]`, corresponding to API (automatic priority interrupt)
levels 0 through 3 and normal program interrupts, if a device doesn’t
support API. Priority is from level 0 to level “4” (PI); within a level,
priority is right to left. The API control variables are updated
centrally; an IO device only deals with `int_hwre`.

Device enable flags are kept in `dev_enb`. The device enable flag, by
convention, is the same bit position as device interrupt flag.

I/O dispatching is done by explicit case decoding in the `IOT`
instruction flow for CPU `IOT`’s, and dispatch through table
`dev_tab[64]` for devices. Each entry in `dev_tab` is a pointer to a
device `IOT` processing routine. The calling sequence for the `IOT`
routine is:

```
new_data = iot_routine(device, pulse, current AC);
```

where

|                             |                                |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------|
| `device`                    | = `instruction<6:11>`          |
| `pulse`                     | = `instruction<12:13’0’15:17>` |
| `new_data<17:0>`            | = new contents of `AC`         |
| `new_data<IOT_V_SKP>`       | = 1 if skip, 0 if not          |
| `new_data<31:IOT_V_REASON>` | = stop code, if non-zero       |

Note that instruction `bit<14>` (clear `AC`) has been processed by the
time the `IOT` routine is called and is always cleared.

If the device responds to the IORS instructions, it must also have an
IORS response routine:

```
IORS_response = iors_routine(void);
```

where

|                 |                                 |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| `IORS_response` | = bit(s) to set in `IORS`, or 0 |

## `DEVICE` Context and Flags

The `DEVICE` `ctxt` (context) field must point to the device information
block (`DIB`), if one exists. The `DEVICE` `flags` field must specify
whether the device supports the `SET ENABLED`/`SET DISABLED` commands
(`DEV_DISABLE`). If a device can be disabled, the state of the device
`flag<DEV_DIS>` must be declared as a register for `SAVE`/`RESTORE`.

## Adding A New I/O Device

### Defining The Device Number and Interrupt Information

Module `pdp18b_defs.h` must be modified to add the device number
definitions, the device interrupt flag definitions, and the `IORS`
response (if any). The device number is the lowest device number that
the device responds to (e.g, 063 for the RP15):

```
#define DEV_NEW        0nn                   /* not 0,033,055 */
```

The device must be assigned to an interrupt level and, if it supports
API, an API channel. Use the next unassigned bit number at the desired
API level:

```
#define INT_V_dev_new  n                     /* V -> a bit number */
#define INT_dev_new    (1u << INT_V_new_dev)
#define API_dev_new    0, 1, 2, 3, or 4      /* 4 means PI */
#define ACH_dev_new    0mm                   /* only if API */
```

If a device requires multiple interrupts, this set of definitions must
be repeated for each interrupt.

With these definitions, I/O devices can manipulate the interrupt system
with simple macros:

```
SET_INT(dev_new)       /* set device interrupt */
CLR_INT(dev_new)       /* clr device interrupt */
TST_INT(dev_new)       /* test device interrupt */
```

If the device responds to `IORS`, an `IORS` response bit (or bits)
should also be defined.

### Adding The Device Information Block

The device information block is declared in the device module, as follows:

```
int32 iotrtn1(int32 instruction, int32 AC);
int32 iotrtn2(int32 instruction, int32 AC);
int32 iorsrtn(void);
/* ... */
DIB dev_dib = { DEV_NEW, num_iot_routines, iorsrtn, { &iotrtn1, &iotrn2, … } };
```

`DEV_NEW` is the device number, and `num_iot_routines` is the number
of `IOT` dispatch routines (allocated contiguously starting at
`DEV_NEW`). If a device number in the range defined by \[`DEV_NEW`,
`DEV_NEW + num_iot_routines - 1`\] is not needed, the corresponding
dispatch address should be `NULL`. If the device does not respond to
`IORS`, then `iorsrtn` should be `NULL`.

# PDP-11, MicroVAX 3900, VAX-780, and PDP-10

## Memory

For the PDP-11, simulated memory is kept in array `uint16 *M`,
dynamically allocated.

For the MicroVAX 3900 and VAX-780, simulated memory is kept in array
`uint32 *M`, dynamically allocated.

For the PDP-10, simulated memory is kept in array `t_uint64 *M`,
dynamically allocated.

Because the three systems use different memory widths and different
I/O mapping schemes, DMA peripherals that are shared among them use
interface routines to access memory.

## Interrupt Structure

The interrupt structure is implemented by array `int_req`, indexed by
priority level (except on the PDP-10, where all levels are kept in one
word). Each device is assigned a request flag in
`int_req[device_IPL]`, according to its priority, with highest
priority at the right (low order bit). To facilitate access to `int_req`
across the three systems, each device `dev` defines three variables:

|               |                                                       |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| `INT_V_`*dev* | the bit number of the device’s interrupt request flag |
| `INT_`*dev*   | the mask of the device’s interrupt request flag       |
| `IPL_`*dev*   | the index into `int_req` for the device’s priority level (PDP-11, MicroVAX 3900, and VAX-780 only) |

Four macros allow simulated devices to access and manipulate interrupt
structures independent of the underlying VM:

|                |                                                  |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `IVCL(dev)`    | vector locator for DIB (`IPL * 32 +` bit number) |
| `IREQ(dev)`    | resolves to `int_req[device_IPL]`                |
| `CLR_INT(dev)` | clears the device’s interrupt request flag       |
| `SET_INT(dev)` | sets the device’s interrupt request flag         |

## I/O Dispatching

### Unibus/Qbus Devices

For Unibus and Qbus devices, I/O dispatching is done by table-driven
address decoding in the I/O page read and write routines. Interrupt
handling is done by table driven processing of vector and interrupt
handling tables. These tables are constructed at run time from device
information blocks (`DIB`’s). Each I/O device has a `DIB` with the
following information:

```
{ IO page base address, IO page length, read_routine, write_routine,
  num_vectors, vector_locator, vector, { &iack_rtn1, &iack_rtn2, … } }
```

The calling sequence for an I/O read is:

```
t_stat read_routine(int32 *data, int32 pa, int32 access)
```

The calling sequence for an I/O write is:

```
t_stat write_routine(int32 data, int32 pa, int32 access)
```

For both, the `access` parameter can have one of the following values:

|          |                                  |
|----------|----------------------------------|
| `READ`   | normal read                      |
| `READC`  | console read (PDP-11 only)       |
| `WRITE`  | word write                       |
| `WRITEC` | console word write (PDP-11 only) |
| `WRITEB` | byte write                       |

I/O read and I/O word write use word (even) addresses; the low order
bit of the address should be ignored. I/O byte write uses byte
addresses, and the data byte to be written is right-justified in the
calling argument.

If the device has vectors, the `vector_locator` field specifies the
position of the vector in the interrupt tables, using macro
`IVCL(dev)`. If the device has static interrupt vectors, they are
specified by the `DIB` vector field and by the `DIB` `num_vectors`
field. The device is assumed to have vectors at `vector, …, vector +
((num_vectors -1) * 4)`. If the device has dynamic interrupt
acknowledge routines, they are specified by the `DIB` interrupt
acknowledge routines. A calling sequence for an interrupt acknowledge
routine is:

```
int32 iack_rtn(void)
```

It returns the interrupt vector for the device, or 0 if there is no
interrupt (passive release).

### Massbus Devices (PDP-11, VAX-780 only)

For Massbus devices, I/O dispatching is done by table-driven address
decoding in the Massbus adapter (RH for the PDP11, MBA for the
VAX-780). These tables are constructed at run time from device
information blocks (`DIB`’s). Each Massbus device has a `DIB` with the
following information:

```
{ Massbus number, 0, mb_read_routine, mb_write_routine,
  0, 0, 0, { &abort_routine } }
```

The calling sequence for a Massbus register read is:

```
t_stat mb_read_routine(int32 *data, int32 offset, int32 drive)
```

The calling sequence for a Massbus register write is:

```
t_stat mb_write_routine(int32 data, int32 offset, int32 drive)
```

For both, offset is the internal register offset of the Massbus
register being accessed, and drive is the unit number of the Massbus
controller being accessed. These routines can return the following
status values:

|           |                                       |
|-----------|---------------------------------------|
| `SCPE_OK` | access ok                             |
| `MBE_NXD` | non-existent drive                    |
| `MBE_NXR` | non-existent register                 |
| `MBE_GOE` | error attempting to initiate function |

The abort routine is called if the Massbus adapter must stop a data
transfer or reset the associated controllers. Its calling sequence is:

```
t_stat mba_abort(void)
```

The abort routine typically invokes the device reset routine to stop
all transfers and reset all device controller state.

## `DEVICE` Context and Flags

For the PDP-11, VAX, and PDP-10, the `DEVICE` `ctxt` (context) field
must point to the device information block (`DIB`), if one exists.

The `DEVICE` `flags` field must specify whether the device is a Unibus
device (`DEV_UBUS`); a Qbus device with 22b DMA capability, or no DMA
capability (`DEV_QBUS`); or a Qbus device with 18b DMA capability
(`DEV_Q18`); a Massbus device (`DEV_MBUS`); or a combination thereof.

The `DEVICE` `flags` field must also specify whether the device supports
the `SET ENABLED`/`SET DISABLED` commands (`DEV_DISABLE`).

Lastly, device addresses and vectors are set in the device’s `DIB` from
the table information in the `pdp11_io_lib.c` module. This is true for
*both* static and floating addresses and vectors.

Most devices do not care whether the I/O bus is Unibus or Qbus. Those
that do can use macro `UNIBUS` to see if the host bus is Unibus (true)
or Qbus (false). On the PDP-11, `UNIBUS` is derived from the CPU
model; on the PDP-10 and VAX-11/780, VAX-11/750 and VAX-11/730, it is
always true; and for the MicroVAX models, it is always false.

## Memory Access Routines

### Unibus/Qbus Devices

Unibus/Qbus DMA devices access memory through four interface routines:

```
int32 Map_ReadB(t_addr ba, int32 bc, uint8 *buf);
int32 Map_ReadW(t_addr ba, int32 bc, uint16 *buf);
int32 Map_WriteB(t_addr ba, int32 bc, uint8 *buf);
int32 Map_WriteW(t_addr ba, int32 bc, uint16 *buf);
```

The arguments to these routines are:

|        |                          |
|--------|--------------------------|
| `ba`   | starting memory address  |
| `bc`   | byte count               |
| `*buf` | pointer to device buffer |

Note that the PDP-10 can only share a small number of PDP-11
peripherals, because of its dependence on 18b transfers on the Unibus;
and that all non-Massbus peripherals are on Unibus.

The routines return the number of bytes not transferred: 0 indicates a
successful transfer. Transfer failures can occur if the mapped address
uses an invalid mapping register or maps to non-existent memory.

### Massbus Devices

Massbus devices access memory through three interface routines, for
read, write, and write check respectively:

```
int32 mba_rdbufW(uint32 mbus, int32 bc, uint16 *buf);
int32 mba_wrbufW(uint32 mbus, int32 bc, uint16 *buf);
int32 mba_chbufW(uint32 mbus, int32 bc, uint16 *buf);
```

The arguments to these routines are:

|        |                          |
|--------|--------------------------|
| `mbus` | Massbus adapter number   |
| `bc`   | byte count               |
| `*buf` | pointer to device buffer |

The routines return the number of bytes successfully transferred. Transfer
failures can occur if a mapped address uses an invalid mapping
register, maps to non-existent memory, or on a write-check, if a
miscompare occurs.

## Adding A New I/O Device


### Defining The Device Parameters

If the device can interrupt, `pdp11_defs.h` (`vaxmod_defs.h`,
`vax780_moddefs.h`, `pdp10_defs.h`) must be modified to add the device
interrupt flag(s) and priority level. The device flag(s) should be
inserted using a spare bit (or bits) at the appropriate priority
level. On the PDP-11, the PIRQ interrupt flags (PIR) must always be
the last (lowest priority) device in the level.

```
/* IPL 4 devices */

#define INT_V_LPT      4
#define INT_V_NEW      5                     /* new IPL 4 dev */
#define INT_V_PIR4     6                     /* used to be 4 */
/* ... */
#define INT_NEW        (1u << INT_V_NEW)
/* ... */
#define IPL_NEW        4
```

### Defining The I/O Page Region Size

The size of the device's I/O page footprint should be defined as
follows:

```
#define IOLN_NEW       010                   /* length = 8 bytes */
```

This definition should appear in your device simulator code just
before it is referenced to fill in the Device Information Block.

### Adding The Device Information Block

The device information block is declared in the device module, as
follows:

```
t_stat new_rd(int32 *data, int32 addr, int32 access);
t_stat new_wr(int32 data, int32 addr, int32 access);
int32 new_iack1(void);
int32 new_iack2(void);

#define IOLN_NEW       010                   /* length = 8 bytes */

DIB new_dib = { IOBA_AUTO, IOLN_NEW, &new_rd, &new_wr,
      num_vectors, IVCL (NEW), VEC_AUTO, { &new_iack1, &new_iack2, … };
```

### Proper setting of your I/O page base address in the Device Information Block.

All Unibus and Qbus devices have some registers present in the I/O
page. The size of the device’s register footprint is mentioned
above. The device's base address in the I/O page can
either be a fixed or a floating address. The vector used by the device
can either be a fixed or a floating vector. The details for all known
Unibus and Qbus devices are present in the entries of auto configure
table (`auto_tab`). Any device you may wish to simulate is likely
already present in this table, you usually need only add your device
name to the existing entry for the device you are simulating.

For example, if you were going to simulate a DPV11, and your device
name is DPV you would find the DPV11 entry in the `auto_tab` table
which looks like:

```
{ { NULL },            1, 2, 8, 8 },             /* DPV11 */
```

You would revise it to look like:

```
{ { “DPV” },           1, 2, 8, 8 },             /* DPV11 */
```

It is a good idea to actively call `auto_config(0, 0)` as the last line
in your device reset routine. This will assure that both the address
and vector will be properly inserted into your Device Information
Block for proper system execution.

### Adding The Device To Autoconfiguration (PDP-11, VAX-11, and Micro VAX only)

If the device is not presently included in the autoconfiguration
table, it must be added to table `auto_tab` in `pdp11_io_lib.c`. Entries
are in rank order (with the exception of devices which have only fixed
addresses AND vectors). The fields for each entry are:

|                  |                                                           |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| `char *dnam[32]` | list of controller names for this device type, maximum 32 |
| `int32 numc` | number of controllers per device name (used by terminal multiplexers) |
| `int32 numv`      | number of vectors per controller                 |
| `int32 amod`      | address modulus                                  |
| `uint32 vmod`     | vector modulus                                   |
| `uint32 fix[32]`  | fixed CSR addresses, maximum 32; 0 = end of list |
| `uint32 fixv[32]` | fixed vectors, maximum 32; 0 = end of list       |

An `amod` value of 0 indicates that the addresses for this device
entry are only fixed. A `vmod` value of 0 indicates that all the
vectors for this entry are fixed. A negative `numv` value indicates that
the `abs(numv)` should be the number of vectors used/reserved, but they
should not be updated in the `DIB` by the auto configure process since
they are set by software.

## CPU and I/O Device Structures

Simulated memory is kept in array `uint16 M[MAXMEMSIZE]`.

The interrupt structure is implemented in three parallel variables:

- `int32 int_req`: interrupt requests. The two high order bits are the
  interrupt enable flag and the interrupts-not-deferred flag
- `int32 dev_done`: device done flags
- `int32 dev_disable`: device interrupt disable flags

Pictorially,

```
+----+----+…+----+----+…+----+----+----+
|ion |indf| |irqa|irqb| |irqx|irqy|irqz| irq_req
+----+----+…+----+----+…+----+----+----+

+----+----+…+----+----+…+----+----+----+
| 0  | 0  | |dona|donb| |donx|dony|donz| dev_done
+----+----+…+----+----+…+----+----+----+

+----+----+…+----+----+…+----+----+----+
| 0  | 0  | |disa|disb| |disx|disy|disz| dev_disable
+----+----+…+----+----+…+----+----+----+

<- fixed -> <------- I/O devices ------>
```

Logically, the relationship is

```
int_req = (int_req & ~INT_DEV) | (dev_done & ~dev_disable);
```

Device enable flags are kept in `iot_enb`. The device enable flag, by
convention, is the same bit position as device interrupt flag.

I/O dispatching is indirectly through dispatch table `dev_table`, which
has one entry for each possible I/O device. Each entry is a structure
of the form:

```
int32    mask;               /* interrupt/done mask bit */
int32    pi;                 /* PI out mask bit */
t_stat   (*iot_routine)();   /* addr of I/O routine */
```

The I/O routine is called by

```
new_data = iot_routine(IOT pulse, IOT subopcode, AC value);
```

where

|                             |                                    |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `new_data<15:0>`            | new contents of AC, if DIA/DIB/DIC |
| `new_data<IOT_V_SKP>`       | 1 if skip, 0 if not                |
| `new_data<31:IOT_V_REASON>` | stop code, if non-zero             |

## DEVICE Context and Flags

The `DEVICE` `ctxt` (context) field must point to the device information
block (`DIB`), if one exists. The `DEVICE` `flags` field must specify
whether the device supports the `SET ENABLED`/`SET DISABLED` commands
(`DEV_DISABLE`). If a device can be disabled, the state of the device
`flag<DEV_DIS>` must be declared as a register for `SAVE`/`RESTORE`.

## Memory Mapping

On mapped Novas and on Eclipses, DMA transfers use a memory map to
translate 15b virtual addresses to physical addresses. The mapping
function is called by:

```
int32 MapAddr(int32 map, int32 addr)
```

with the following arguments:

|        |                       |
|--------|-----------------------|
| `map`  | map number, usually 0 |
| `addr` | virtual address       |

The routine returns the physical address to be used for the transfer.

## Adding A New I/O Device

### Defining The Device Number And The Done/Interrupt Flag

Module `nova_defs.h` must be modified to add the device number
definitions and the device interrupt flag definitions.

```
#define DEV_NEW        0nn               /* can’t be 00, 01 */
```

Device flags are kept as a bit vector. If priority is unimportant, the device flag can be defined as one of the currently unused bits:

```
#define INT_V_NEW      1                 /* new */
/*...*/
#define INT_NEW        (1 << INT_V_NEW)
```

If the device requires a specific priority with respect to existing
devices, it must be assigned the appropriate flag bit, and the other
device flag bits moved up or down.

The device’s PI mask bit must also be defined:

```
#define PI_NEW         000200
```

### Adding The Device Information Block

The device information block is declared in the device module, as follows:

```
int32 iot(int32 pulse, int32 code, int32 AC);
/* ... */
DIB new_dib = { DEV_NEW, INT_new, PI_new, &iot };
```
