Most devices can be disabled or enabled with the `SET <dev> DISABLED`
and `SET <dev> ENABLED` commands, respectively.

The `LOAD` and `DUMP` commands are not implemented.

## Central Processor (CPU)

Central processor options include the CPU model, the CPU features, and
the size of main memory.

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET CPU SIGMA5` | Set CPU model to Sigma 5 |
| `SET CPU SIGMA6` | Set CPU model to Sigma 6 |
| `SET CPU SIGMA7` | Set CPU model to Sigma 7 |
| `SET CPU SIGMA7B` | Set CPU model to Sigma 7 "big" memory |
| `SET CPU SIGMA8` | Set CPU model to Sigma 8 |
| `SET CPU SIGMA9` | Set CPU model to Sigma 9 |
| `SET CPU 550` | Set CPU model to 550 |
| `SET CPU 560` | Set CPU model to 560 |
| `SET CPU FP` | Enable floating point, if available |
| `SET CPU NOFP` | Disable floating point, if optional |
| `SET CPU DECIMAL` | Enable decimal, if available |
| `SET CPU NODECIMAL` | Disable decimal, if optional |
| `SET CPU LASLAM` | Enable LAS/LAM instructions (6/7 only) |
| `SET CPU NOLASLAM` | Disable LAS/LAM instructions |
| `SET CPU MAP` | Enable memory map, if available |
| `SET CPU NOMAP` | Disable memory map, if optional |
| `SET CPU WRITELOCK` | Enable write locks, if available |

| `SET CPU 512K` | Set memory size to 512KW |
| `SET CPU 1M` | Set memory size to 1024KW |

If memory size is being reduced, and the memory being truncated contains
non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation. Data in the
truncated portion of memory is lost. Initial configuration is Sigma 7
CPU, 4 channels, 128KW of memory, floating point, decimal, map and
writelocks options enabled.

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `PC` | 17 | program counter |
| `R0..R15` | 32 | active general registers |
| `PSW1` | 32 | processor status word 1 |
| `PSW2` | 32 | processor status word 2 |
| `PSW4` | 32 | processor status word 4 (5x0 only) |
| `CC` | 4 | condition codes |
| `RP` | 5 | register block selector |
| `SSW1..SSW4` | 1 | sense switches |
| `PDF` | 1 | processor fault flag |
| `ALARM` | 1 | console alarm |
| `ALENB` | 1 | console alarm enable |
| `PCF` | 1 | console controlled flop |
| `EXULIM` | 8 | limit for nested EXU's |
| `STOP_ILL` | 1 | if 1, stop on undefined instruction |
| `REG` | 512 | register blocks, 32 x 16 |
| `WRU` | 8 | interrupt character |

The CPU provides an address converter to display the byte (halfword,
word, or doubleword) address equivalent of a byte (halfword, word, or
doubleword) input address. Optionally, the input address can be run
through memory relocation:

```
SHOW {-flags} CPU {BA,HA,WA,DA}=address
```

BA, HA, WA, DA specify that the input address is a byte, halfword, word,
or doubleword address, respectively. The flags are:

| Flag | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-v` | input address is virtual |
| `-b` | output is byte address |
| `-h` | output is halfword address |
| `-w` | output is word address (default) |
| `-d` | output is doubleword address |

For example:

```
sim> SHOW -B CPU WA=100
Physical word 100: physical byte 400
```

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions. This is controlled by the `SET CPU HISTORY` and
`SHOW CPU HISTORY` commands:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET CPU HISTORY` | Clear history buffer |
| `SET CPU HISTORY=0` | Disable history |
| `SET CPU HISTORY=n` | Enable history, length = `n` |
| `SHOW CPU HISTORY` | Print CPU history |
| `SHOW CPU HISTORY=n` | Print first `n` entries of CPU history |

The maximum length for the history is 1M entries.

## Memory Map (MAP)

The memory map implements two distinct forms of protection: memory
mapping and access protection on virtual addresses; and write lock
protection on physical addresses. It also includes a skeleton
implementation of the memory status registers from the Sigma 8 and 9,
and the XDS 550 and 560. It implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `REL[0:511]` | 11 | relocation registers |
| `ACC[0:511]` | 2 | access controls |
| `WLK[0:2047]` | 4 | write locks |
| `SR0[32]` | 32 | memory status register 0 |
| `SR1[32]` | 32 | memory status register 1 |

## Interrupt System (INT)

The Sigma series implements a complex, multi-level interrupts system,
with a minimum of 32 distinct interrupts. The interrupt system can be
expanded to up to 224 interrupt levels. It implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `IHIACT` | 9 | highest active interrupt level |
| `IHIREQ` | 9 | highest outstanding interrupt request |
| `IREQ[0:15]` | 16 | interrupt requests |
| `IENB[0:15]` | 16 | interrupt enabled flags |
| `IARM[0:15]` | 16 | interrupt armed flags |
| `S9_SNAP` | 32 | Sigma 9 snapshot register |
| `S9_MARG` | 32 | Sigma 9 margins registers |
| `S5X0_IREG[0:31]` | 32 | 5X0 internal registers (unused) |

The simulator supports a variable number of external interrupt blocks.
The minimum number is one, the maximum is four (5X0) to thirty-two
(Sigma 7). The user can change the number of external interrupt blocks
with the `SET INT EIBLKS` command:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET INT EIBLKS=4` | Configure four external interrupt blocks |

Although the Sigma series supports configurable interrupt group
priorities, the simulator uses a fixed priority arrangement, high to low
as follows:

- counters

- counter overflow

- I/O and panel interrupt

- external group 2 (there is no external group 1)

- external group 3

- etc.

## Channels (CHANA .. CHANH)

A Sigma 32b system has up to eight I/O channels, designated A, B, C, D,
E, F, G, and H. The association between a device and a channel is
displayed by the `SHOW <dev> CHAN` command and `SHOW <dev> DVA`
command:

```
SHOW MT CHAN
channel=A

SHOW MT DVA
address=00
```

The user can change the association with the SET \<dev\> CHAN=\<chan\>
command, where `<chan>` is a channel letter, and with the
`SET <dev> DVA=<addr>` command, where `<addr>` is a legal device
address:

```
SET MT CHAN=C
SET MT DVA=4
SHOW MT CHAN,DVA
channel=B
address=04
```

The default channel assignments for the simulator are:

| Device | Channel | Address |
|---|---|---:|
| `MT` | A | 0 |
| `TT` | A | 1 |
| `LP` | A | 2 |
| `PT` | A | 5 |
| `COC` | A | 6 |
| `RAD` | B | 0 |
| `DK` | B | 1 |
| `DPA` | C | 0 |
| `DPB` | D | 1 |

The user can display all the channel registers associated with a device
with the `SHOW <dev> CSTATE` command:

```
SHOW MT CSTATE
```

Each channel has eight registers. The registers are arrays, with entry 1
for device \[0\], entry \[1\] for device 1, etc. A channel supports a
maximum of 32 devices.

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `CLC[0:31]` | 16 | channel location counter (doubleword) |
| `CMD[0:31]` | 8 | current channel command |
| `CMF[0:31]` | 8 | channel command flags |
| `BA[0:31]` | 24 | byte address (byte) |
| `BC[0:31]` | 16 | byte count |
| `CHS[0:31]` | 16 | channel status flags |
| `CHI[0:31]` | 8 | channel interrupt flags |
| `CHSF[0:31]` | 8 | channel simulator flags |

## 7012 Console Teletype (TT)

The console Teletype (TT) consists of two units. Unit 0 is for console
input, unit 1 for console output. The console implements these
registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `KPOS` | 32 | number of characters input |
| `TPOS` | 32 | number of characters input |
| `TTIME` | 24 | time from I/O initiation to interrupt |
| `PANEL` | 8 | character code for panel interrupt |

The PANEL variable defaults to control-P. If the user types the control
panel character, it is not echoed; instead, a control panel interrupt is
generated.

The console can be set to one of two modes, `7P` or `UC`:

| Mode | Input characters | Output characters |
|---|---|---|
| `UC` | lower case converted to upper case | lower case converted to upper case |
| `7P` | non-printing characters suppressed |  |

The default mode is UC. The console character set is a subset of EBCDIC.
By default, the console is assigned to channel A as device 1.

## 7060 Paper Tape Reader (PT)

The paper tape controller implements two units. Unit 0 (PT0) is for
paper tape input, unit 1 (PT1) for paper tape output. Paper tapes are
simulated as disk files. For the reader, register RPOS specifies the
number of the next data item to be read. For the punch, register PPOS
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing RPOS or PPOS, the user can backspace or advance the reader or
punch.

The paper tape controller implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `CMD` | 9 | current command or state |
| `NZC` | 1 | non-zero character seen since `ATTACH` |
| `RPOS` | 32 | position in the reader input file |
| `RTIME` | 24 | time from reader I/O initiation to response |
| `RSTOP_IOE` | 1 | stop on reader I/O error |
| `PPOS` | 32 | position in the punch output file |
| `PTIME` | 24 | time from punch I/O initiation to response |
| `PSTOP_IOE` | 1 | punch stop on I/O error |

The paper-tape reader supports the `BOOT` command. `BOOT PT0`
simulates the standard console fill sequence.

Reader error handling is as follows:

| Error | `RSTOP_IOE` | Processed as |
|---|---:|---|
| not attached | 1 | report error and stop |
| not attached | 0 | out of tape |
| end of file | 1 | report error and stop |
| end of file | 0 | out of tape |
| OS I/O error | x | report error and stop |

Punch error handling is as follows:

| Error | `PSTOP_IOE` | Processed as |
|---|---:|---|
| not attached | 1 | report error and stop |
| not attached | 0 | out of tape |
| OS I/O error | x | report error and stop |

By default, the paper tape reader is assigned to channel A as device 5.

## 7440 or 7450 Line Printer (LP)

The line printer (LPT) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the printer.

The line printer implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `CMD` | 9 | current command or state |
| `BUF[0:131]` | 7 | data buffer |
| `PASS` | 1 | printing pass (7440 only) |
| `INH` | 1 | inhibit spacing flag |
| `RUNAWAY` | 1 | runaway carriage-control tape flag |
| `CCT[0:131]` | 8 | carriage control tape |
| `CCTP` | 8 | pointer into carriage control tape |
| `CCTL` | 8 | length of carriage control tape |
| `POS` | 32 | position in the output file |
| `TIME` | 24 | time from I/O initiation to response |
| `STOP_IOE` | 1 | stop on I/O error |

The line printer model can be set to either the 7440 or the 7450:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET LP 7440` | Set model to 7440 |
| `SET LP 7450` | Set model to 7450 |

The default model is the 7450.

A carriage control tape can be loaded with the `SET LP CCT` command:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET LP CCT=<file>` | Load carriage-control tape from `<file>` |

The format of a carriage control tape consists of multiple lines. Each
line contains an optional repeat count, enclosed in parentheses,
optionally followed by a series of column numbers separated by commas.
Column numbers must be between 0 and 7. The following are all legal
carriage control specifications:

\<blank line\> no punch

\(5\) 5 lines with no punches

1,5,7 columns 1, 5, 78 punched

(10)2 10 lines with column 2 punched

1 column 1 punched

The default form is 1 line long, with every column punched.

Error handling is as follows:

| Error | `STOP_IOE` | Processed as |
|---|---:|---|
| not attached | 1 | report error and stop |
| not attached | 0 | out of paper |
| OS I/O error | x | report error and stop |

By default, the line printer is assigned to channel A as device 2.

## Real-Time Clock (RTC)

The Sigma 32b series implements four real-time clocks. Three of them can
be set to a variety of frequencies, including off, 50Hz, 60Hz, 100Hz,
and 500hz. The fourth always runs at 500Hz. The frequency of each clock
can be adjusted as follows:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET RTC {C1,C2,C3}=freq` | Set clock 1/2/3 to the specified frequency |

The frequency of each clock can be displayed as follows:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SHOW RTC {C1,C2,C3,C4}` | Show clock 1/2/3/4 frequency |

Clocks 1 and 2 default to off, clocks 3 and 4 to 500Mhz.

The RTC can also show the state of all real-time events in the simulator:

```
SHOW RTC EVENTS
```

The real-time clocks autocalibrate; the clock interval is adjusted up or
down so that the clock tracks actual elapsed time.

## Character-Oriented Communications Subsystem (MUX)

The character-oriented communications subsystem implements up to 64
asynchronous interfaces, with modem control. The subsystem has two
controllers: MUX for the scanner, and MUXL for the individual lines. The
terminal multiplexer performs input and output through Telnet sessions
connected to a user-specified port. The `ATTACH` command specifies the
port to be used:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `ATTACH MUX <port>` | Set up listening port |

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities.

Unlike the console, the MUX operates in ASCII. Each line (each unit of
`MUXL`) supports four character processing modes: `UC`, `7P`, `7B`, and
`8B`.

| Mode | Input characters | Output characters |
|---|---|---|
| `UC` | high-order bit cleared, lower case converted to upper case | high-order bit cleared, lower case converted to upper case |
| `7P` | high-order bit cleared, non-printing characters suppressed | high-order bit cleared |
| `7B` | high-order bit cleared | high-order bit cleared |
| `8B` | no changes | no changes |

The default is UC. In addition, each line supports output logging. The
`SET MUXLn LOG` enables logging on a line:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET MUXLn LOG=filename` | Log output of line `n` to `filename` |

The SET MUXLn NOLOG command disables logging and closes the open log
file, if any.

Once MUX is attached and the simulator is running, the multiplexer
listens for connections on the specified port. It assumes that the
incoming connections are Telnet connections. The connections remain open
until

disconnected either by the Telnet client, a SET MUX DISCONNECT command,
or a DETACH MUX command.

Other special multiplexer commands:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SHOW MUX CONNECTIONS` | Show current connections |
| `SHOW MUX STATISTICS` | Show statistics for active connections |
| `SET MUXLn DISCONNECT` | Disconnect the specified line |

The controller (`MUX`) implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `STA[0:63]` | 8 | status, lines 0 to 63 |
| `RBUF[0:63]` | 8 | receive buffer, lines 0 to 63 |
| `XBUF[0:63]` | 8 | transmit buffer, lines 0 to 63 |
| `SCAN` | 6 | current scanner line |
| `SLCK` | 1 | scanner locked flag |
| `CMD` | 2 | channel command or state |

The lines (`MUXL`) implement these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `TIME[0:63]` | 24 | transmit time, lines 0 to 63 |

The terminal multiplexer does not support save and restore. All open
connections are lost when the simulator shuts down or MUX is detached.
By default, the multiplexer is assigned to channel A as device 6.

## 7240, 7270, 7260, 7265, 7275, and T3281 Moving Head Disk Controllers (DPA, DPB)

The Sigma 32b series supports two moving head disk controllers (DPA,
DPB). Each can be set to model one of six controllers (7240, 7270,
7260, 7265, 7275, or Telefile 3281):

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET DP{A,B} 7240` | Set DPA or DPB to 7240 |
| `SET DP{A,B} 7270` | Set DPA or DPB to 7270 |
| `SET DP{A,B} 7260` | Set DPA or DPB to 7260 |
| `SET DP{A,B} 7265` | Set DPA or DPB to 7265 |
| `SET DP{A,B} 7275` | Set DPA or DPB to 7275 |
| `SET DP{A,B} T3281` | Set DPA or DPB to Telefile 3281 |

The default for DPA is the 7270; for DPB, the T3281.

The 7240 and 7270 support up to 8 7242 and 7271 drives, respectively.
The 7260, 7265, and 7275 support up to 15 7261, 7266, and 7276 drives,
respectively. The T3281 supports up to 15 drives of three different
types, which can be mixed:

| Model | Cylinders | Heads | Sectors |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `3288` | 17 | 5 | 823 |
| `3282` | 11 | 19 | 815 |
| `3283` | 17 | 19 | 815 |

The command to set a drive to a particular model is:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET DPn <drive_type>` | Set unit `n` to the specified drive type |
| `SET DPn AUTO` | Set unit `n` to autosize on `ATTACH` |

Units can be set ENABLED or DISABLED. The DP controller supports the
BOOT command.

The DP controllers implement the registers listed below. Registers
suffixed with `[0:14]` are replicated per drive.

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `FLAGS` | 8 | controller flags |
| `DIFF` | 16 | cylinder difference |
| `SKI` | 16 | queued seek interrupts |
| `TEST` | 16 | test mode flags |
| `ADDR[0:14]` | 32 | current disk address, drives 0 to 14 |
| `CMD[0:14]` | 32 | current disk command, drives 0 to 14 |
| `TIME` | 24 | time between word transfers |
| `STIME` | 24 | seek time |
| `WLK` | 16 | write lock switches |
| `STOP_IOE` | 1 | stop on I/O error |

Error handling is as follows:

| Error | `STOP_IOE` | Processed as |
|---|---:|---|
| not attached | 1 | report error and stop |
| not attached | 0 | disk not ready |
| end of file | x | assume rest of disk is zero |
| OS I/O error | x | report error and stop |

By default, DPA is assigned to channel C as device 0, and DPB is
assigned to channel D as device 0.

## 7250 Cartridge Disk Controller (DK)

The cartridge disk controller (DK) supports up to 8 drives. DK options
include the ability to make drives write enabled or write locked:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET DKn LOCKED` | Set drive `n` write locked |
| `SET DKn WRITEENABLED` | Set drive `n` write enabled |

The cartridge disk controller implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `CMD` | 9 | current command or state |
| `FLAGS` | 8 | controller flags |
| `ADDR` | 8 | current disk address |
| `TIME` | 24 | interval between data transfers |
| `STIME` | 24 | seek interval |
| `STOP_IOE` | 1 | stop on I/O error |

Error handling is as follows:

| Error | `STOP_IOE` | Processed as |
|---|---:|---|
| not attached | 1 | report error and stop |
| not attached | 0 | non-existent disk |

DK data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file and OS I/O
errors cannot occur. By default, the cartridge disk controller is
assigned to channel B as device 1.

## 7211/7212 or 7231/7232 Fixed Head Disk (RAD)

The Sigma 32b series supports two models of fixed head disk:

7211/7212 1.343MW

7231/7232 1.572MW

The user can select the model as follows:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET RAD 7211` | Set model to 7211/7212 |
| `SET RAD 7231` | Set model to 7231/7232 |

The fixed head disk controller supports four units (drives). Units can
be set ENABLED or DISABLED.

The fixed head disk controller implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `CMD` | 9 | current command or state |
| `FLAGS` | 8 | controller flags |
| `ADDR` | 15 | current disk address |
| `WLK` | 16 | write lock switches |
| `TIME` | 24 | interval between data transfers |

Error handling is as follows:

| Error | `STOP_IOE` | Processed as |
|---|---:|---|
| not attached | 1 | report error and stop |
| not attached | 0 | non-existent disk |

RAD data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of file and OS I/O
errors cannot occur. By default, the fixed head disk is assigned to
channel B as device 0.

## 723X Nine-Track Magnetic Tape (MT)

The magnetic tape controller supports up to eight units. MT options
include the ability to make units write enabled or write locked.

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET MTn LOCKED` | Set unit `n` write locked |
| `SET MTn WRITEENABLED` | Set unit `n` write enabled |
| `SET MTn CAPAC=m` | Set unit `n` capacity to `m` MB (`0` = unlimited) |
| `SHOW MTn CAPAC` | Show unit `n` capacity in MB |

Units can also be set `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`. The magnetic tape
controller supports the `BOOT` command. `BOOT MTn` simulates the
standard console fill sequence for unit `n`.

The magnetic tape implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `BUF[0:65535]` | 8 | transfer buffer |
| `BPTR` | 17 | buffer pointer |
| `BLNT` | 17 | buffer length |
| `RWINT` | 8 | queued rewind interrupts |
| `TIME` | 24 | interval between character transfers |
| `CTIME` | 24 | channel response time |
| `RWTIME` | 24 | rewind time |
| `UST[0:7]` | 8 | drive status, drives 0 to 7 |
| `UCMD[0:7]` | 8 | channel command, drives 0 to 7 |
| `POS[0:7]` | 32 | position, drives 0 to 7 |
| `STOP_IOE` | 1 | stop on I/O error |

Error handling is as follows:

| Error | Processed as |
|---|---|
| not attached | tape not ready; if `STOP_IOE`, stop |
| end of file | end of tape |
| OS I/O error | end of tape; if `STOP_IOE`, stop |

By default, the magnetic tape is assigned to channel A as device 0.

# Symbolic Display and Input

The Sigma 32b simulator implements symbolic display and input. Display
is controlled by command line switches:

| Switch | Action |
|---|---|
| `-a` | display as ASCII character (byte addressing) |
| `-b` | display as byte (byte addressing) |
| `-e` | display as EBCDIC character (byte addressing) |
| `-h` | display as halfword (halfword addressing) |
| `-ca` | display as four ASCII characters (word addressing) |
| `-ce` | display as four EBCDIC characters (word addressing) |
| `-m` | display instruction mnemonics (word addressing) |

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by
command line switches:

| Input | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `#` or `-a` | ASCII character (byte addressing) |
| `’` or `-e` | EBCDIC character (byte addressing) |
| `-b` | hexadecimal byte (byte addressing) |
| `-h` | hexadecimal halfword (halfword addressing) |
| `"` or `-ac` | four packed ASCII characters (word addressing) |
| `-ae` | four packed EBCDIC characters (word addressing) |
| alphabetic | instruction mnemonic (word addressing) |
| numeric | hexadecimal word (word addressing) |

Instruction input uses (more or less) standard XDS Sigma assembler
syntax. All instructions are variants on the same basic form:

```
mnemonic{,reg} {*{address{,index}}}
```

Mnemonics are symbolic names for instructions. Registers are decimal
values between 0 and 15. ‘\*’ represents indirect addressing. Addresses
are hexadecimal and can be signed if used as literals. Index registers
are always less than 8 and thus can be considered decimal.

Examples:

```
LW,5 *100,7
AI,14 -3
LCFI A
WAIT
BCR,12 400
BNOV 10FE
SLS,6 -8
```

The extended branch and shift mnemonics are recognized and decoded properly.
