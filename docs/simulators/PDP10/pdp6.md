# Introduction

Originally the DEC PDP-10 computer started as the PDP-6. This was a 36
bit computer that was designed for timesharing, which was introduced
in 1964. The original goal of the machine was to allow for processing
of many 6 bit characters at a time. 36 bits were also common in
machines like the IBM 7090, GE 645, and Univac 11xx lines. Several
influences shaped the design of the PDP-6, including CTSS, Lisp, and
support for larger memory.

The PDP-6 was canceled by DEC due to production problems. The
engineers designed a smaller replacement, which happened to be a 36
bit computer that looked very much like the PDP-6. This was called the
PDP-10, later renamed to "DECSystem-10". The system supported up to
256K words of memory.

The first PDP-10 was labeled KA10, and added a few instructions to the
PDP-6. Both the PDP-6 and PDP-10 used a base and limit relocation
scheme. The KA10 generally offered two registers, one for user data
and the second for user shared code. These were referred to as the
Low-Segment and High-Segment; the High-Segment could be shared with
several jobs.

The next version was called KI10 for Integrated. This added support
for paging and double precision floating point instructions. It also
added 4 sets of registers to improve context switching time. It could
also support up to 4 megawords of memory.

Following the KI10 was the KL10 (for Low-Cost). The KL10 added double
precision integer instructions and instructions to improve COBOL
performance. This was the first version which was microcoded. The KL10
was extended to support user programs larger than 256K.

The final version to make it to market was the KS10 (for Small), this
was a bit-slice version of the PDP-10 which used Unibus devices that
were cheaper than the KL10 devices.

The original operating system for the PDP-6/PDP-10 was just called
"Monitor". It was designed to fit into 6K words. Around the third
release swapping was added. The sixth release saw the addition of
virtual memory. Around the fourth release it was given the name
"TOPS-10". Around this time BBN was working on a paging system and
implemented it on the PDP-10. This was called "TENEX". This was later
adopted by DEC and became "TOPS-20".

During the mid 1960s a group at MIT, who were not happy with how
Multics was being developed, decided to create their own operating
system, which they called Incompatible Timesharing System, or
"ITS". The name was a play on an earlier project called the Compatible
Timesharing System, or "CTSS". CTSS was implemented by MIT on their
IBM 7090 as an experimental system that allowed multiple time sharing
users to co-exist on the same machine running batch processing, hence
the term "Compatible".

Also during the mid 1960s a group at Stanford Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory (SAIL), started with a version of TOPS-10 and heavily
modified it to become WAITS.

During the 1970s, Tymshare modified TOPS-10 to support random access
files, paging with working sets, and spawnable processes. This ran on
the KI10, KL10, and KS10.

The PDP-10 was ultimately replaced by the VAX.

| `SHOW CPU HISTORY`   | print CPU history                      |
| `SHOW CPU HISTORY=n` | print first `n` entries of CPU history |

Instruction tracing shows the Program Counter, the contents of `AC`
selected, the computed effective address. `AR` is generally the
contents the memory location referenced by `EA`. `RES` is the result
of the instruction. `FLAGS` shows the flags after the instruction is
executed. `IR` shows the instruction being executed.

## Unit Record I/O Devices

### Console Teletype (`CTY`) (Device 120)

The console station allows for communications with the operating system.

Reads a paper tape from a disk file.

### Paper Tape Punch (`PTP`) (Device 100)

Punches a paper tape to a disk file.

### Card Reader (`CR`) (Device 150)

The card reader (CR) reads data from a disk file. Card reader files
can either be text (one character per column) or column binary (two
characters per column). The file type can be specified with a set
command:

| command                 | action                              |
|-------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `SET CRn FORMAT=TEXT`   | Sets ASCII text mode                |
| `SET CRn FORMAT=BINARY` | Sets for binary card images.        |

| `ATTACH CRn -s <file>`          | Add a file onto the current cards to read. |
| `ATTACH CRn -e <file>`          | After the file is read in, the reader will receive an end-of-file flag. |

### Card Punch (`CP`) (Device 110)

The card punch (`CP`) writes data to a disk file. Cards are simulated
as ASCII lines with terminating newlines. Card punch files can either
be text (one character per column) or column binary (two characters
per column). The file type can be specified with a set command:

| command                | action                              |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `SET CP FORMAT=TEXT`   | Sets ASCII text mode                |
| `SET CP FORMAT=BINARY` | Sets for binary card images.        |
| `SET CP FORMAT=BCD`    | Sets for BCD records.               |
| `SET CP FORMAT=CBN`    | Sets for column binary BCD records. |
| `SET CP FORMAT=AUTO`   | Automatically determines format.    |

### Type 340 Graphics Display (Device 130)

By default this device is not enabled. When enabled and commands are
sent to it a graphics window will display.

## DCS Type 630 Terminal Multiplexer (Device 300)

Terminal multiplexers must be attached in order to work. The `ATTACH`
command specifies the port to be used for Telnet sessions:

| command                  | action                |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| `ATTACH <device> <port>` | set up listening port |

where `port` is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities.

Once attached and the simulator is running, the multiplexer listens
for connections on the specified port. It assumes that any incoming
connection is a Telnet connection. The connections remain open until
disconnected either by the Telnet client, a `SET <device> DISCONNECT`
command, or a `DETACH <device>` command.

| command                     | action              |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| `SET <device> DISCONNECT=n` | Disconnect line `n` |

The `<device>` implements the following special `SHOW` commands:

| command                     | action                                         |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| `SHOW <device> CONNECTIONS` | Displays current connections to the `<device>` |
| `SHOW <device> STATISTICS`  | Displays statistics for active connections     |
| `SHOW <device> LOG`         | Display logging for all lines                  |

Logging can be controlled as follows:

| command                       | action                               |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `SET <device> LOG=n=filename` | Log output of line `n` to `filename` |
| `SET <device> NOLOG`          | Disable logging and close log file   |

### `DCT` Type 136 Data Control (Device 200/204)

This device acted as a data multiplexer for the DECtapes/magtapes and
disks. Individual devices could be assigned channels on this
device. Devices which use the `DCT` include a `DCT` option that takes
two octal digits, the first is the `DCT` device 0 or 1, the second is
the channel 1 to 7.

### DTC Type 551 DECtape controller (Device 210)

This was the standard DECtape controller for the PDP-6. This
controller loads the tape into memory and uses the buffered
version. You need to specify which `DCT` unit and channel the tape is
connected to.

| command          | action                                             |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `SET DTC DCT=uc` | Sets the DTC to connect to `DCT` unit and channel. |

Each individual tape drive supports several options:

| command                | action                                           |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `SET DTCn LOCKED`      | Sets the mag tape to be read only.               |
| `SET DTCn WRITEENABLE` | Sets the mag tape to be writable.                |
| `SET DTCn 18b`         | Default, tapes are considered to be 18bit tapes. |
| `SET DTCn 16b`         | Tapes are converted from 16 bit to 18bit.        |
| `SET DTCn 12b`         | Tapes are converted from 12 bit to 18bit.        |

### `MTC` Type 516 Magtape Controller (Device 220)

This was the standard magtape controller for the PDP-6. This device
handled only 7 track tapes. The simulator has the option to
automatically translate 8 track tapes into 7 track tapes. You need to
specify which `DCT` unit and channel the tape is connected to.

| command          | action                                               |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `SET MTC DCT=uc` | Sets the `MTC` to connect to `DCT` unit and channel. |

Each individual tape drive supports several options:

| command                | action                                      |
|------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| `SET MTCn LOCKED`      | Sets this unit to be read only.             |
| `SET MTCn WRITEENABLE` | Sets this unit to be writable.              |
| `SET MTCn 9T`          | Sets this unit to simulated 9 track format. |
| `SET MTCn 7T`          | Sets this unit to read/write 7 track tapes (with parity) |

### DSK Type 270 Disk Controller (Device 270)

The 270 disk controller could support up to 4 units. The controller
had to be connected to a type 136 Data Controller. You need to specify
which `DCT` unit and channel the disk is connected to.

| command          | action                                             |
|------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `SET DSK DCT=uc` | Sets the `DSK` to connect to `DCT` unit and channel. |

Each individual disk drive supports several options:

| command                | action                          |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `SET DSKn LOCKED`      | Sets this unit to be read only. |
| `SET DSKn WRITEENABLE` | Sets this unit to be writable.  |

# Symbolic Display and Input

The PDP-6 simulator implements symbolic display and input. These are
controlled by the following switches to the `EXAMINE` and `DEPOSIT`
commands:

| switch | effect                               |
|--------|--------------------------------------|
| `-a` | display/enter ASCII data             |
| `-p` | display/enter packed ASCII data      |
| `-c` | display/enter sixbit character data  |
| `-m` | display/enter symbolic instructions  |
| none | display/enter octal data             |

Symbolic instructions can be of the formats:

- `opcode ac, operand`
- `opcode operands`
- `i/o_opcode device, address`

Operands can be one or more of the following in order:

- Optional `@` for indirection.
- `+` or `-` to set sign.
- Octal number
- Optional `(AC)` for indexing.

Breakpoints can be set at real memory address. The PDP-6 supports
three types of breakpoints. Execution, Memory Access and Memory
Modify. The default is execution. Adding `-R` to the breakpoint
command will stop the simulator on access to that memory location,
either via fetch, indirection or operand access. Adding `-w` will stop
