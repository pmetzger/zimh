# Introduction

Originally the DEC PDP-10 computer started as the PDP-6. This was a 36
bit computer that was designed for timesharing, which was introduced
in 1964. The original goal of the machine was to allow for processing
of many 6 bit characters at a time. 36 bits were also common in
machines like the IBM 7090, GE 645, and Univac 11xx lines. Several
influences shaped the design of the PDP-6, including CTSS, Lisp, and
support for larger memory.

The PDP-6 was canceled by DEC due to production problems. The
engineers designed a smaller replacement, which happened to be a 36
bit computer that looked very much like the PDP-6. This was called the
PDP-10, later renamed to "DECSystem-10". The system supported up to
256K 36-bit words of memory.

The first PDP-10 was labeled KA10, and added a few instructions to the
PDP-6. Both the PDP-6 and PDP-10 used a base and limit relocation
scheme. The KA10 generally offered two registers, one for user data
and the second for user shared code. These were referred to as the
Low-Segment and High-Segment. The High-Segment could be shared with
several jobs.

The next version was called KI10 for Integrated. This added support
for paging and double precision floating point instructions. It also
added 4 sets of registers to improve context switching time. It could
also support up to 4 megawords of memory.

Following the KI10 was the KL10 (for Low-Cost). The KL10 added double
precision integer instructions and instructions to improve COBOL
performance. This was the first version which was microcoded. The KL10
was extended to support user programs larger than 256K.

The final version to make it to market was the KS10 (for Small). This
was a bit-slice version of the PDP-10 which used Unibus devices which
were cheaper than the KL10 devices.

The original operating system for the PDP-6/PDP-10 was just called
"Monitor". It was designed to fit into 6K words. Around the third
release swapping was added. The sixth release saw the addition of
virtual memory. Around the fourth release it was given the name
"TOPS-10". Around this time BBN was working on a paging system and
implemented it on the PDP-10. This was called "TENEX". This was later
adopted by DEC and became "TOPS-20".

During the mid 1960s a group at MIT, who were not happy with how
Multics was being developed, decided to create their own operating
system, which they called Incompatible Timesharing System, or
"ITS". The name was a play on an earlier project called the Compatible
Timesharing System, or "CTSS". CTSS was implemented by MIT on their
IBM 7090 as an experimental system that allowed multiple time sharing
users to co-exist on the same machine running batch processing, hence
the term "Compatible".

Also during the mid 1960s a group at Stanford Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory (SAIL), started with a version of TOPS-10 and heavily
modified it to become WAITS.

During the 1970s, Tymshare modified TOPS-10 to support random access
files, paging with working sets, and spawnable processes. This ran on
the KI10, KL10, and KS10.

The PDP-10 was ultimately replaced by the VAX.

This is controlled by the `SET CPU HISTORY` and `SHOW CPU HISTORY`
commands:

| command              | action                               |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| `SET CPU HISTORY`    | clear history buffer                 |

| `SET CPU HISTORY=n`  | enable history, length = `n`           |
| `SHOW CPU HISTORY`   | print CPU history                    |
| `SHOW CPU HISTORY=n` | print first `n` entries of CPU history |

Instruction tracing shows the Program Counter, the contents of `AC`
selected, the computed effective address. `AR` is generally the
contents the memory location referenced by `EA`. `RES` is the result
of the instruction. `FLAGS` shows the flags after the instruction is
executed. `IR` shows the instruction being executed.

## Unit Record I/O Devices

| `ATTACH CRn -e <file>` | After a file is read in, the reader will receive an end-of-file flag. |

### Card Punch (`CP`) (Device 110)

The card punch (`CP`) writes data to a disk file. Cards are simulated
as ASCII lines with terminating newlines. Card punch files can either
be text (one character per column) or column binary (two characters
per column). The file type can be specified with a set command:

| command                | action                              |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| `SET CP FORMAT=TEXT`   | Sets ASCII text mode                |

or in the ATTACH command:

| command                          | action                                 |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `ATTACH CP <file>`               | Attaches a file                        |
| `ATTACH CP -f <format> <file>` | Attaches a file with the given format. |

### Line Printer (`LPT`) (Device 124)

The line printer (`LPT`) writes data to a disk file as ASCII text with
terminating newlines. It currently handles standard signals that
control paper advance.

| command         | action                                       |

The DK10 timer module does not have any settable options.

### TM10 Magnetic Tape (`MTA`) (Device 340,344)

The TM10 was the most common tape controller on KA10 and KI10. The
TM10 came in two models, the TM10A and the TM10B. The B model added a
DF10 which allowed the tape data to be transferred without
intervention of the CPU. The device has 2 options.

| command        | action                                    |
|----------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `SET MTA TYPE=t` | Sets the type of the controller to A or B |

Each individual tape drive supports several options: `MTA` is used as
an example.

| command                | action                                    |
|------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| `SET MTAn 7T`          | Sets the magtape unit to 7 track format.  |
| `SET MTAn 9T`          | Sets the magtape unit to 9 track format.  |
| `SET MTAn LOCKED`      | Sets the magtape to be read only.         |
| `SET MTAn WRITEENABLE` | Sets the magtape to be writable.          |

### TD10 DECtape (`DT`) (Device 320,324)

The TD10 was the standard DECtape controller for KA and KIs. This
controller loads the tape into memory and uses the buffered
version. Each individual tape drive supports several options: `DT` is
used as an example.

| command               | action                                           |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `SET DTn LOCKED`      | Sets the DECtape to be read only.                |
| `SET DTn WRITEENABLE` | Sets the DECtape to be writable.                 |
| `SET DTn 18b`         | Default, tapes are considered to be 18bit tapes. |
| `SET DTn 16b`         | Tapes are converted from 16 bit to 18bit.        |
| `SET DTn 12b`         | Tapes are converted from 12 bit to 18bit.        |

## Disk I/O Devices

The PDP-10 supported many disk controllers.

### `FHA` Disk Controller (Device 170)

The RC10 disk controller used a DF10 to transfer data to memory. There
were two types of disks that could be connected to the RC10 the RD10
and RM10. The RD10 could hold up to 512K words of data. The RM10 could
hold up to 345K words of data.

Each individual disk drive supports several options: `FHA` is used as
an example.

| command                | action                          |
|------------------------|---------------------------------|
| `SET FHAn RD10`        | Sets this unit to be an `RD10`. |
| `SET FHAn RM10`        | Sets this unit to be an `RM10`. |
| `SET FHAn LOCKED`      | Sets this unit to be read only. |
| `SET FHAn WRITEENABLE` | Sets this unit to be writable.  |

### `DPA`/`DPB` Disk Controller (Device 250/254)

The RP10 disk controller used a DF10 to transfer data to memory. There
were three types of disks that could be connected to the RP10 the
`RP01`, `RP02`, `RP03`. The `RP01` held up to 1.2M words, the `RP02`
5.2M words, `RP03` 10M words. The second controller is `DPB`. Disks
can be stored in one of several file formats, `SIMH`, `DBD9`, and
`DLD9`. The later two are for compatibility with other simulators.

Each individual disk drive supports several options: `DPA` is used as
an example.

| command         | action                          |
|-----------------|---------------------------------|
| `SET DPAn RP01` | Sets this unit to be an `RP01`. |
| `SET DPAn RP02` | Sets this unit to be an `RP02`. |
| `SET DPAn RP03` | Sets this unit to be an `RP03`. |
| `SET DPAn HEADERS` | Enables the RP10 to execute write headers function. |
| `SET DPAn NOHEADERS` | Prevents the RP10 to execute write headers function. |
| `SET DPAn LOCKED` | Sets this unit to be read only. |
| `SET DPAn WRITEENABLE` | Sets this unit to be writable. |

To attach a disk use the `ATTACH` command:

| command                          | action                                 |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `ATTACH DPAn <file>`             | Attaches a file                        |
| `ATTACH DPAn -f <format> <file>` | Attaches a file with the given format. |
| `ATTACH DPAn -n <file>`          | Creates a blank disk.                  |

Format can be `SIMH`, `DBD9`, or `DLD9`.

### DDC10 Drum controller for TENEX

The DEC RES-10 drum controller is used by TENEX for swapping. This device
is disabled by default.

## Massbus Devices

Massbus devices are attached via RH10’s. Devices start a device 270
and go up (274, 360, 364, 370, 374). For TOPS-10, devices need to be
in the order `RS`, `RP`, `TU`. By default `RS` disks are disabled. The
first unit which is not enabled will get device 270, units will be
assigned the next available address automatically. The device
configuration must match that which is defined in the OS.

### `RP` Disk Drives

Up to 4 strings of up to 8 `RP` drives can be configured. By default
the third and fourth controllers are disabled. These are addresses as
`RPA`, `RPB`, `RPC`, `RPD`. Disks can be stored in one of several file
formats, `SIMH`, `DBD9`, and `DLD9`. The later two are for
compatibility with other simulators.

|                        |                                            |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `SET RPAn RP04`        | Sets this unit to be an `RP04` (19MWords)  |
| `SET RPAn RP06`        | Sets this unit to be an `RP06` (39MWords)  |
| `SET RPAn RP07`        | Sets this unit to be an `RP07` (110MWords) |
| `SET RPAn LOCKED`      | Sets this unit to be read only.            |
| `SET RPAn WRITEENABLE` | Sets this unit to be writable.             |

To attach a disk use the `ATTACH` command:

|                                  |                                        |
|----------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `ATTACH RPAn <file>`             | Attaches a file                        |
| `ATTACH RPAn -f <format> <file>` | Attaches a file with the given format. |
| `ATTACH RPAn -n <file>`          | Creates a blank disk.                  |

Format can be `SIMH`, `DBD9`, or `DLD9`.

### `RS` Disk Drives

One string of up to 8 `RS` drives can be configured. These drives are
fixed head swapping disks. By default they are disabled.

|                        |                                            |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `SET FSAn RS03`        | Sets this unit to be an `RS03` (262KWords) |
| `SET FSAn RS04`        | Sets this unit to be an `RS04` (262KWords) |
| `SET FSAn LOCKED`      | Sets this unit to be read only.            |
| `SET FSAn WRITEENABLE` | Sets this unit to be writable.             |

### `TU` Tape Drives

The TUA is a Massbus tape controller using a TM03 formatter. There
can be one per RH10 and it can support up to 8 drives.

|                        |                                    |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `SET TUAn LOCKED`      | Sets the mag tape to be read only. |
| `SET TUAn WRITEENABLE` | Sets the mag tape to be writable.  |

### DC10E Terminal Controller (Device 240)

The `DC` device was the standard terminal multiplexer for the KA10 and
KI10’s. Lines came in groups of 8. For modem control there was a
second port for each line. These could be offset by any number of
groups.

| command          | action                                              |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `SET DC LINES=n` | Set the number of lines on the DC10, multiple of 8. |
| `SET DC MODEM=n` | Set the start of where the modem control DEC10E lines begins. |

All terminal multiplexers must be attached in order to work. The
`ATTACH` command specifies the port to be used for Telnet sessions:

| command                  | action                |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| `ATTACH <device> <port>` | Set up listening port |

where `port` is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities.

Once attached and the simulator is running, the multiplexer listens
for connections on the specified port. It assumes that any incoming
connection is a Telnet connection. The connections remain open until
disconnected either by the Telnet client, a `SET <device> DISCONNECT`
command, or a `DETACH <device>` command.

| command                     | action              |
|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| `SET <device> DISCONNECT=n` | Disconnect line `n` |

The `<device>` implements the following special `SHOW` commands:

| command                     | action                                       |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `SHOW <device> CONNECTIONS` | Displays current connections to the `<device>` |
| `SHOW <device> STATISTICS`  | Displays statistics for active connections   |
| `SHOW <device> LOG`         | Display logging for all lines.               |

Logging can be controlled as follows:

| command                       | action                             |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `SET <device> LOG=n=filename` | Log output of line `n` to filename |
| `SET <device> NOLOG`          | Disable logging and close log file |

## Network Devices

### `IMP` Interface Message Processor (Device 460)

This allows the KA/KI to connect to the Internet. Currently only
supported under ITS. ITS and other OSes that used the IMP did not
support modern protocols and typically required a complete rebuild to
change the IP address. Because of this the IMP processor includes
built in NAT and DHCP support. For ITS the system generated IP packets
which are translated to the local network. If the `HOST` is set to
`0.0.0.0` there will be no translation. If `HOST` is set to an IP
address then it will be mapped into the address set in IP. If `DHCP`
is enabled the `IMP` will issue a DHCP request at startup and set IP
to the address that is given. By default this device is not enabled.

| command | action |
|---|---|
| `SET IMP MAC=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx` | Set the `MAC` address of the `IMP` to the value given. |
| `SET IMP IP=ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd/dd` | Set the external `IP` address of the `IMP` along with the net mask in bits. |
| `SET IMP GW=ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd` | Set the Gateway address for the `IMP`. |
| `SET IMP HOST=ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd` | Sets the IP address of the PDP-10 system. |
| `SET IMP DHCP` | Allows the `IMP` to acquire an IP address from the local network via `DHCP`. Only `HOST` must be set if this feature is used. |
| `SET IMP NODHCP` | Disables the `IMP` from making DHCP queries |
| `SET IMP DHCPIP=ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd` | The address of the `DHCP` server, generally this is for display only. |
| `SET IMP MIT` | Sets the `IMP` to look like the `IMP` used by `MIT` for ITS. |
| `SET IMP BBN` | Sets the `IMP` to behave like generic `BBN` `IMP`. (Not implemented yet). |
| `SET IMP WAITS` | Sets the `IMP` for Stanford style `IMP` for `WAITS`. |

The `IMP` device must be attached to a `TAP` or `NAT` interface. To
determine which devices are available use the `SHOW ETHERNET` to list
the potential interfaces. Check out the `Readme_ethernet.txt` from the
doc directory.

The `IMP` device can be configured in several ways. Either it can
connect directly to an ethernet port (via `TAP`) or it can be
connected via a `TUN` interface. If configured via `TAP` interface the
`IMP` will behave like any other ethernet interface and if asked
obtain its own address. In environments where this is not desired the `TUN`
interface can be used. When configured under a `TUN` interface the
simulated network is a collection of ports on the local host. These
can be mapped based on configuration options, see the
`0readme_ethernet.txt` file as to options.

With the `IMP` interface, the IP address of the simulated system is
static, and under ITS is configured into the system at compile
time. This address should be given to the `IMP` with the `SET IMP
HOST=<ip>`, the `IMP` will direct all traffic it sees to this
address. If this address is not the same as the address of the system
as seen by the network, then this address can be set with `SET IMP
IP=<ip>`, and `SET IMP GW=<ip>`, or `SET IMP DHCP` which will allow
the `IMP` to request an address from a local DHCP server. The `IMP`
will translate the packets it receives and sends to look like they
appeared from the desired address. The `IMP` will also correctly translate FTP
requests in this configuration.

When running under a `TUN` interface, `IMP` is on a virtual `10.0.2.0`
network. The default gateway is `10.0.2.1`, with the default `IMP` at
`10.0.2.15`. For this mode DHCP can be used.

# Symbolic Display and Input

The KI10 simulator implements symbolic display and input. These are
controlled by the following switches to the `EXAMINE` and `DEPOSIT`
commands:

| switch    | action                                                                          |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-v`      | Looks up the address via translation, will return nothing if address is not valid. |
| `-u`      | With the `-v` option, use user space instead of executive space.               |
| `-a`      | Display/Enter ASCII data.                                                      |
| `-p`      | Display/Enter packed ASCII data.                                               |
| `-c`      | Display/Enter Sixbit character data.                                           |
| `-m`      | Display/Enter symbolic instructions.                                           |
| `default` | Display/Enter octal data.                                                      |

Symbolic instructions can be of the formats:

- `opcode ac, operand`
- `opcode operands`
- `i/o_opcode device, address`

Operands can be one or more of the following in order:

- Optional `@` for indirection.
- `+` or `-` to set sign.
- Octal number
- Optional `(AC)` for indexing.

Breakpoints can be set at real memory address. The PDP-10 supports
three types of breakpoints. Execution, Memory Access and Memory
Modify. The default is Execution. Adding `-R` to the breakpoint
command will stop the simulator on access to that memory location,
either via fetch, indirection or operand access. Adding `-w` will stop
the simulator when the location is modified.

The simulator can load `RIM` files, `SAV` files, `EXE` files, WAITS
octal `DMP` files, and MIT `SBLK` files.

When instruction history is enabled, the history trace shows internal
status of various registers at the start of the instruction execution.

| field   | meaning                                                                  |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PC`    | Shows the PC of the instruction executed.                                |
| `AC`    | The contents of the referenced AC.                                       |
| `EA`    | The final computed Effective address.                                    |
| `AR`    | Generally the operand that was computed.                                 |
| `RES`   | The AR register after the instruction was complete.                      |
| `FLAGS` | The values of the FLAGS register before execution of the instruction.     |
| `IR`    | The fetched instruction followed by the disassembled instruction.         |

The PDP-10 simulator allows for memory reference and memory modify
breakpoints with the `-r` and `-w` options given to the break command.
