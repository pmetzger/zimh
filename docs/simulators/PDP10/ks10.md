# Introduction

Originally the DEC PDP-10 computer started as the PDP-6. This was a 36
bit computer that was designed for timesharing, which was introduced
in 1964. The original goal of the machine was to allow for processing
of many 6 bit characters at a time. 36 bits were also common in
machines like the IBM 7090, GE 645, and Univac 11xx lines. Several
influences shaped the design of the PDP-6, including CTSS, Lisp, and
support for larger memory.

The PDP-6 was canceled by DEC due to production problems. The
engineers designed a smaller replacement, which happened to be a 36
bit computer that looked very much like the PDP-6. This was called the
PDP-10, later renamed to "DECSystem-10". The system supported up to
256K 36-bit words of memory.

The first PDP-10 was labeled the KA10, and added a few instructions to
the PDP-6. Both the PDP-6 and PDP-10 used a base and limit relocation
scheme. The KA10 generally offered two registers, one for user data
and the second for user shared code. These were referred to as the
Low-Segment and High-Segment. The High-Segment could be shared with
several jobs.

The next version was called KI10 for Integrated. This added support
for paging and double precision floating point instructions. It also
added 4 sets of registers to improve context switching time. It could
also support up to 4 megawords of memory.

Following the KI10 was the KL10 (for Low-Cost). The KL10 added double
precision integer instructions and instructions to improve COBOL
performance. This was the first version which was microcoded. The KL10
was extended to support user programs larger than 256K.

The final version to make it to market was the KS10 (for Small). This
was a bit-slice version of the PDP-10 which used Unibus devices which
were cheaper than the KL10 devices.

The original operating system for the PDP-6/PDP-10 was just called
"Monitor". It was designed to fit into 6K words. Around the third
release swapping was added. The sixth release saw the addition of
virtual memory. Around the fourth release it was given the name
"TOPS-10". Around this time BBN was working on a paging system and
implemented it on the PDP-10. This was called "TENEX". This was later
adopted by DEC and became "TOPS-20".

During the mid 1960s a group at MIT, who were not happy with how
Multics was being developed, decided to create their own operating
system, which they called Incompatible Timesharing System, or
"ITS". The name was a play on an earlier project called the Compatible
Timesharing System, or "CTSS". CTSS was implemented by MIT on their
IBM 7090 as an experimental system that allowed multiple time sharing
users to co-exist on the same machine running batch processing, hence
the term "Compatible".

Also during the mid 1960s a group at Stanford Artificial Intelligence
Laboratory (SAIL), started with a version of TOPS-10 and heavily
modified it to become WAITS.

During the 1970s, Tymshare modified TOPS-10 to support random access
files, paging with working sets, and spawnable processes. This ran on
the KI10, KL10, and KS10.

The PDP-10 was ultimately replaced by the VAX.

commands:

| command              | action                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|
| `SET CPU HISTORY`    | clear history buffer                   |

| `SET CPU HISTORY=n`  | enable history, length = `n`           |
| `SHOW CPU HISTORY`   | print CPU history                      |
| `SHOW CPU HISTORY=n` | print first `n` entries of CPU history |

Instruction tracing shows the Program Counter, the contents of `AC`
selected, the computed effective address. `AR` is generally the
contents the memory location referenced by `EA`. `RES` is the result
of the instruction. `FLAGS` shows the flags after the instruction is
executed. `IR` shows the instruction being executed.

## KS10 front end processor

### Console Teletype (`CTY`)

The console station allows for communications with the operating system.

| command      | action                              |

|----------------|---------------------------|
| `SET CTY STOP` | Deposit 1 in location 30. |

## Unit Record I/O Devices

### LP20 Printer (`LP20`)

The line printer (`LP20`) writes data to a disk file as ASCII text with
terminating newlines. It currently handles standard signals to control
paper advance. Currently only one line printer device is
supported.

| command       | action                            |

## Disk I/O Devices

The PDP-10 supported many disk controllers. The KS10 supports only
Massbus devices.

## Massbus Devices

Massbus devices are attached via RH11s.

### `RP` Disk drives

The KS10 supports one RH11 controller with up to 8 `RP` drives.
Disks can be stored in one of
several file formats, `SIMH`, `DBD9` and `DLD9`. The latter two are for
compatibility with other simulators.

| command                | action                                     |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `SET RPAn RP04`        | Sets this unit to be an `RP04` (19MWords)  |
| `SET RPAn RP06`        | Sets this unit to be an `RP06` (39MWords)  |
| `SET RPAn RP07`        | Sets this unit to be an `RP07` (110MWords) |
| `SET RPAn LOCKED`      | Sets this unit to be read only.            |

| `ATTACH RPAn -f <format> <file>` | Attaches a file with the given format. |
| `ATTACH RPAn -n <file>`         | Creates a blank disk.                  |

Format can be `SIMH`, `DBD9`, `DLD9`.

### `TUA` Tape drives

The TU is a Massbus tape controller using a TM03 formatter.

| command                | action                             |
|------------------------|------------------------------------|

| `SET TUA BR=value`   | Sets the interrupt priority of device. (default: 6) |
| `SET TUA CTL=value`  | Sets the Unibus adapter number. (default: 3)        |

## Terminal Multiplexer I/O Devices

All terminal multiplexers must be attached in order to work. The
`ATTACH` command specifies the port to be used for Telnet sessions:

| command                  | action                |
|--------------------------|-----------------------|
| `ATTACH <device> <port>` | set up listening port |

where `port` is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities.

Once attached and the simulator is running, the multiplexer listens
for connections on the specified port. It assumes that any incoming
connection is a Telnet connection. The connections remain open until
disconnected either by the Telnet client, a `SET <device> DISCONNECT`
command, or a `DETACH <device>` command.

| command                       | action              |
|-------------------------------|---------------------|
| `SET <device> DISCONNECT=n`   | Disconnect line `n` |

The `<device>` implements the following special `SHOW` commands:

| command                     | action                                       |
|-----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `SHOW <device> CONNECTIONS` | Displays current connections to the `<device>` |
| `SHOW <device> STATISTICS`  | Displays statistics for active connections   |
| `SHOW <device> LOG`         | Displays logging for all lines.              |

Logging can be controlled as follows:

| command                       | action                             |
|-------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `SET <device> LOG=n=filename` | Log output of line `n` to filename |
| `SET <device> NOLOG`          | Disable logging and close log file |

### DZ11 Terminal Controller

The `DZ` device was the standard terminal multiplexer for the
KS10. Lines came in groups of 8. A max of 32 lines can be supported.

| command           | action                                               |
|-------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `SET DZ LINES=n`  | Set the number of lines on the DZ11, multiple of 8.  |
| `SET DZ ADDR=value` | Sets the Unibus address of device. (default: 760000) |
| `SET DZ VECT=value` | Sets the interrupt vector of device. (default: 340)  |
| `SET DZ BR=value`   | Sets the interrupt priority of device. (default: 5)  |
| `SET DZ CTL=value`  | Sets the Unibus adapter number. (default: 3)         |

## Network Devices

### `IMP` Interface Message Processor

This allows the KA/KI to connect to the Internet. Currently only
supported under ITS. ITS and other OS that used the `IMP` did not
support modern protocols and typically required a complete rebuild to
change the IP address. Because of this the `IMP` processor includes
built in NAT and DHCP support. For ITS the system generated IP packets
which are translated to the local network. If the `HOST` is set to
`0.0.0.0` there will be no translation. If `HOST` is set to an IP
address then it will be mapped into the address set in `IP`. If `DHCP`
is enabled the `IMP` will issue a DHCP request at startup and set `IP`
to the address that is provided. DHCP is enabled by default.

| command | action |
|---|---|
| `SET IMP MAC=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx` | Set the `MAC` address of the `IMP` to the value given. |
| `SET IMP IP=ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd/dd` | Set the external `IP` address of the `IMP` along with the net mask in bits. |
| `SET IMP GW=ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd` | Set the Gateway address for the `IMP`. |
| `SET IMP HOST=ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd` | Sets the IP address of the PDP-10 system. |
| `SET IMP DHCP` | Allows the `IMP` to acquire an IP address from the local network via `DHCP`. Only `HOST` must be set if this feature is used. |
| `SET IMP NODHCP` | Disables the `IMP` from making `DHCP` queries |
| `SET IMP ARP=ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd=xx:xx:xx:xx:xx:xx` | Creates a static `ARP` entry for the IP address with the indicated MAC address. |
| `SET IMP ADDR=value` | Sets the Unibus address of device. (default: 767600) |
| `SET IMP VECT=value` | Sets the interrupt vector of device. (default: 250) |
| `SET IMP BR=value` | Sets the interrupt priority of device. (default: 6) |
| `SET IMP CTL=value` | Sets the Unibus adapter number. (default: 3) |
| `SHOW IMP ARP` | Displays the IP address to MAC address table. |

The IMP device must be attached to an available Ethernet interface. To
determine which devices are available use the `SHOW ETHERNET` to list
the potential interfaces. Check out the `0readme_ethernet.txt` from
the top of the source directory.

The `IMP` device can be configured in several ways. Either it can
connect directly to an ethernet port (via `TAP`) or it can be
connected via a `TUN` interface. If configured via `TAP` interface the
`IMP` will behave like any other ethernet interface and if asked
obtain its own address. In environments where this is not desired, the `TUN`
interface can be used. When configured under a `TUN` interface the
simulated network is a collection of ports on the local host. These
can be mapped based on configuration options, see the
`0readme_ethernet.txt` file as to options.

With the `IMP` interface, the IP address of the simulated system is
static, and under ITS is configured into the system at compile
time. This address should be given to the IMP with the `SET IMP
HOST=<ip>`, the `IMP` will direct all traffic it sees to this
address. If this address is not the same as the address of the system
as seen by the network, then this address can be set with `SET IMP
IP=<ip>`, and `SET IMP GW=<ip>`, or `SET IMP DHCP` which will allow
the `IMP` to request an address from a local `DHCP` server. The `IMP`
will translate the packets it receives and sends to look like they
appeared from the desired address. The `IMP` will also correctly translate FTP
requests in this configuration.

When running under a `TUN` interface, IMP is on a virtual `10.0.2.0`
network. The default gateway is `10.0.2.1`, with the default `IMP` at
`10.0.2.15`. For this mode `DHCP` can be used.

### CH11 Chaosnet interface

Chaosnet was another method of network access for ITS. Chaosnet can
be connected to another ITS system or a VAX/PDP-11 running BSD Unix or
VMS. Chaosnet runs over UDP protocol under UNIX. You must specify a
node number, peer to talk to and your local UDP listening port. All
UDP packets are sent to the peer for further processing.

| command         | action                               |
|-----------------|--------------------------------------|
| `SET CH NODE=n` | Set the Node number for this system. |
| `SET CH PEER=ddd.ddd.ddd.ddd:dddd` | Set the Peer address and port number. |
| `SET CH ADDR=value` | Sets the Unibus address of device. (default: 764140) |
| `SET CH VECT=value` | Sets the interrupt vector of device. (default: 270) |
| `SET CH BR=value` | Sets the interrupt priority of device. (default: 6) |
| `SET CH CTL=value` | Sets the Unibus adapter number. (default: 3) |

The `CH` device must be attached to a UDP port number. This is where
it will receive UDP packets from its peer.

### KMC11 communications controller

The KMC11-A is a general purpose microprocessor that is used in
several DEC products. The KDP is an emulation of one of those
products: COMM IOP-DUP. The COMM IOP-DUP microcode controls and
supervises 1 - 16 DUP-11 synchronous communications line interfaces,
providing scatter/gather DMA, message framing, modem control, CRC
validation, receiver resynchronization, and address recognition. The
DUP-11 lines are assigned to the KMC11 by the (emulated) operating
system, but SimH must be told how to connect them.

### DUP11 network interface

DUP11 devices are used by DECNET to link machines together. They are a
synchronous serial interface. This is implemented by UDP to send
packets to the remote machine.

| command           | action                                                  |
|-------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `SET DUP LINES=n` | Sets number of DUP11 lines supported; current max is 2. |
| `SET DUPn SPEED=bits/sec` | Set speed of link, default of 0 means no restrictions. |
| `SET DUPn CORRUPTION=factor` | Specify corruption factor. |
| `SET DUPn W3` | Enable Reset option |
| `SET DUPn NOW3` | Disable reset option |
| `SET DUPn W5` | Enable A dataset control option. |
| `SET DUPn NOW5` | Disable A dataset control option. |
| `SET DUPn W6` | Enable A & B dataset control option. |
| `SET DUPn NOW6` | Disable A & B dataset control option. |
| `SET DUP ADDR=value` | Sets the Unibus address of device. (default: 760300) |
| `SET DUP VECT=value` | Sets the interrupt vector of device. (default: 570) |
| `SET DUP BR=value` | Sets the interrupt priority of device. (default: 5) |
| `SET DUP CTL=value` | Sets the Unibus adapter number. (default: 3) |

The `DUP` device must be attached to a UDP port number. This is where
it will receive UDP packets from its peer.

The communication line performs input and output through a TCP session
(or UDP session) connected to a user-specified port. The `ATTACH`
command specifies the port to be used as well as the peer address:

```
ATTACH DUP0 {interface:}port{,UDP},Connect=peerhost:port
```

where `port` is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities.

Specifying symmetric attach configuration (with both a listen port and
a peer address) will cause the side receiving an incoming connection
to validate that the connection actually comes from the connection to
the destination system.

A symmetric attach configuration is required when using UDP packet
transport.

The default connection uses TCP transport between the local system and
the peer. Alternatively, UDP can be used by specifying UDP on the
`ATTACH` command.

For more connection options, view the Help attach command for the `DUP`.

# Symbolic Display and Input

The KS10 simulator implements symbolic display and input. These are
controlled by the following switches to the `EXAMINE` and `DEPOSIT`
commands:

| switch    | action                                                                          |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `-v`      | Looks up the address via translation, will return nothing if address is not valid. |
| `-u`      | With the `-v` option, use user space instead of executive space.               |
| `-a`      | Display/Enter ASCII data.                                                      |
| `-p`      | Display/Enter packed ASCII data.                                               |
| `-c`      | Display/Enter Sixbit character data.                                           |
| `-m`      | Display/Enter symbolic instructions.                                           |
| `default` | Display/Enter octal data.                                                      |

Symbolic instructions can be of the formats:

- `opcode ac, operand`
- `opcode operands`
- `i/o_opcode device, address`

Operands can be one or more of the following in order:

- Optional `@` for indirection.
- `+` or `-` to set sign.
- Octal number
- Optional `(AC)` for indexing.

Breakpoints can be set at real memory address. The PDP-10 supports
three types of breakpoints. Execution, Memory Access and Memory
Modify. The default is execution. Adding `-R` to the breakpoint
command will stop the simulator on access to that memory location,
either via fetch, indirection or operand access. Adding `-w` will stop
the simulator when the location is modified.

The simulator can load `RIM` files, `SAV` files, `EXE` files, WAITS octal
`DMP` files, and MIT `SBLK` files.

When instruction history is enabled, the history trace shows internal
status of various registers at the start of the instruction execution.

| field   | meaning                                                                  |
|---------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PC`    | Shows the PC of the instruction executed.                                |
| `AC`    | The contents of the referenced AC.                                       |
| `EA`    | The final computed Effective address.                                    |
| `AR`    | Generally the operand that was computed.                                 |
| `RES`   | The AR register after the instruction was complete.                      |
| `FLAGS` | The values of the FLAGS register before execution of the instruction.     |
| `IR`    | The fetched instruction followed by the disassembled instruction.         |

The PDP-10 simulator allows for memory reference and memory modify
breakpoints with the `-r` and `-w` options given to the break command.
