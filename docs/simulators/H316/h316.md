# H316/H516 Features

The Honeywell 316/516 simulator is configured as follows:

| Device name(s) | Simulates |
|---|---|
| `CPU` | H316/H516 CPU with 16/32KW memory |
| `PTR` | 316/516-50 paper tape reader |
| `PTP` | 316/516-52 paper tape punch |
| `LPT` | 316/516 line printer |
| `TTY` | 316/516-33 console terminal |
| `MT` | 4100 seven track magnetic tape with four drives |
| `CLK` | 316/516-12 real time clock |
| `FHD` | 4400 fixed head disk |
| `DP` | 4623/4651/4720 disk pack controller with eight drives |
| `WDT` | watch dog timer |
| `RTC` | IMP/TIP real time clock |
| `IMP` | IMP/TIP specific hardware |
| `MI1` | IMP/TIP modem interface |
| `MI2` | IMP/TIP modem interface |
| `MI3` | IMP/TIP modem interface |
| `MI4` | IMP/TIP modem interface |
| `MI5` | IMP/TIP modem interface |
| `HI1` | IMP Host Interface |
| `HI2` | IMP Host Interface |
| `HI3` | IMP Host Interface |
| `HI4` | IMP Host Interface |

The H316/H516 simulator implements several unique stop conditions:

- Decode of an undefined instruction, and `STOP_INST` is set
- Reference to an undefined I/O device, and `STOP_DEV` is set
- More than `INDMAX` indirect references are detected during memory
  reference address decoding
- DMA/DMC direction does not agree with I/O device operation
- A write operation is initiated on a write-locked magnetic tape unit
  (hangs the real system)
- A disk write overruns the specified record size (destroys the rest of
  the track on the real system)
- A disk track has an illegal format

The `LOAD` and `DUMP` commands are not implemented.

## CPU

CPU options include choice of instruction set, memory size, DMC option,
and number of DMA channels.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET CPU HSA` | Enable high-speed arithmetic instructions |
| `SET CPU NOHSA` | Disable high-speed arithmetic instructions |
| `SET CPU 4K` | Set memory size to 4K |
| `SET CPU 8K` | Set memory size to 8K |
| `SET CPU 12K` | Set memory size to 12K |
| `SET CPU 16K` | Set memory size to 16K |
| `SET CPU 24K` | Set memory size to 24K |
| `SET CPU 32K` | Set memory size to 32K |
| `SET CPU DMC` | Enable the DMC option |
| `SET CPU NODMC` | Disable the DMC option |
| `SET CPU DMA=n` | Set the number of DMA channels to `n` (0-4) |

If memory size is being reduced, and the memory being truncated contains
non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation. Data in the
truncated portion of memory is lost. Initial memory size is 32K. By
default, the HSA and DMC options are enabled, and four DMA channels are
configured.

### Extended Interrupts

The H316 came with one interrupt vector and 16 individually maskable
interrupt sources as standard but could optionally be extended to
support up to 48 additional individually maskable interrupt sources,
each with its own unique vector. Extended interrupts are enabled with
the command:

```
SET CPU EXTINT=16
```

and the command

```
SET CPU EXTINT=0
```

restores the original default H316 single-interrupt behavior. Note
that the IMP and TIP custom hardware required one additional bank of
16 interrupts.

Only 16 extended interrupts (out of a possible 48) are currently implemented.

### DMA channels

The CPU includes a special `SHOW` command to display the state of the
DMA channels:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SHOW CPU DMAn` | Show DMA channel `n` |

### Break on Write

The H316 emulation supports "break on memory write" breakpoints in
addition to the standard "break on execution" type. For example, the
command

```
BREAK -W 2000
```

will cause a break to occur any time memory location 2000<sub>8</sub>
is written. All the usual SIMH breakpoint options, including address
ranges and commands to be executed automatically upon breaking, work
here too.

Break on write has two restrictions. First, setting a write breakpoint
on a DMC channel pointer location, 20<sub>8</sub> through
57<sub>8</sub>, will break only on explicit programmed writes to that
address. Implicit DMC operations will not cause a break. Second,
remember that when *any* break occurs SIMH prints the PC and the
instruction *after* the one which actually caused the break. It will
always be the previous instruction which actually modified the
breakpoint location.

### CPU State

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| `P` | 15 | Program counter |
| `A` | 16 | A register |
| `B` | 16 | B register |
| `X` | 16 | Index register |
| `SC` | 16 | Shift count |
| `C` | 1 | Carry flag |
| `EXT` | 1 | Extend flag |
| `PME` | 1 | Previous mode extend flag |
| `EXT_OFF` | 1 | Extend-off pending flag |
| `DP` | 1 | Double-precision flag |
| `SS1..4` | 1 | Sense switches 1 to 4 |
| `ION` | 1 | Interrupts enabled |
| `INODEF` | 1 | Interrupts not deferred |
| `INTREQ` | 16 | Interrupt requests |
| `EXTINT` | 16 | Extended interrupt requests |
| `EXTENB` | 16 | Extended interrupt enables |
| `DEVRDY` | 16 | Device ready flags (read only) |
| `DEVENB` | 16 | Device interrupt enable flags (read only) |
| `CHREQ` | 20 | DMA/DMC channel requests |
| `DMAAD[0:3]` | 16 | DMA channel current address, channels 1 to 4 |
| `DMAWC[0:3]` | 15 | DMA channel word count, channels 1 to 4 |
| `DMAEOR[0:3]` | 1 | DMA end-of-range flag, channels 1 to 4 |
| `STOP_INST` | 1 | Stop on undefined instruction |
| `STOP_DEV` | 1 | Stop on undefined device |
| `INDMAX` | 8 | Indirect address limit |
| `PCQ[0:63]` | 15 | PC prior to last `JMP`, `JSB`, or interrupt; most recent PC change first |
| `WRU` | 8 | Interrupt character |

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions. This is controlled by the `SET CPU HISTORY` and
`SHOW CPU HISTORY` commands:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET CPU HISTORY` | Clear history buffer |
| `SET CPU HISTORY=0` | Disable history |
| `SET CPU HISTORY=n` | Enable history, length = `n` |
| `SHOW CPU HISTORY` | Print CPU history |
| `SHOW CPU HISTORY=n` | Print first `n` entries of CPU history |

The maximum length for the history is 65,536 entries.

## Programmed I/O Devices

### 316/516-50 Paper Tape Reader (PTR)

The paper tape reader (PTR) reads data from a disk file. The POS
register specifies the number of the next data item to be read. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the reader.

The paper tape reader can be set to operate in binary, ASCII, or Unix
ASCII mode:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET PTR BINARY` | Binary mode |
| `SET PTR ASCII` | ASCII mode |
| `SET PTR UASCII` | Unix ASCII mode |

The mode can also be set by a switch setting in the `ATTACH` command:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `ATT -B PTR <file>` | Binary mode |
| `ATT -A PTR <file>` | ASCII mode |
| `ATT -U PTR <file>` | Unix ASCII mode |

In ASCII or Unix ASCII mode, all non-zero characters have the high order
bit forced on. In Unix ASCII mode, newline is converted to CR, and LF is
inserted as the following character.

The paper tape reader supports the `BOOT` command. `BOOT PTR` copies
the absolute binary loader into memory and starts it running.

The paper tape reader implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| `BUF` | 8 | Last data item processed |
| `INTREQ` | 1 | Device interrupt request |
| `READY` | 1 | Device ready |
| `ENABLE` | 1 | Device interrupts enabled |
| `POS` | 32 | Position in the input file |
| `TIME` | 24 | Time from I/O initiation to interrupt |
| `STOP_IOE` | 1 | Stop on I/O error |

Error handling is as follows:

| Error | `STOP_IOE` | Processed as |
|---|---|---|
| not attached | 1 | report error and stop |
| not attached | 0 | out of tape |
| end of file | 1 | report error and stop |
| end of file | 0 | out of tape |
| OS I/O error | x | report error and stop |

### 316/516-52 Paper Tape Punch (PTP)

The paper tape punch (PTP) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the punch. The default
position after `ATTACH` is to position at the end of an existing file.
A new file can be created if you attach with the `-N` switch.

The paper tape punch can be set to operate in binary, ASCII, or Unix
ASCII mode:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET PTP BINARY` | Binary mode |
| `SET PTP ASCII` | ASCII mode |
| `SET PTP UASCII` | Unix ASCII mode |

The mode can also be set by a switch setting in the `ATTACH` command:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `ATT -B PTP <file>` | Binary mode |
| `ATT -A PTP <file>` | ASCII mode |
| `ATT -U PTP <file>` | Unix ASCII mode |

In ASCII or Unix ASCII mode, all characters are masked to 7b before
being written to the output file. In Unix ASCII mode, LF is converted to
newline, and CR is discarded.

The paper tape punch implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| `BUF` | 8 | Last data item processed |
| `INTREQ` | 1 | Device interrupt request |
| `READY` | 1 | Device ready |
| `ENABLE` | 1 | Device interrupts enabled |
| `POWER` | 1 | Device powered up |
| `POS` | 32 | Position in the output file |
| `TIME` | 24 | Time from I/O initiation to interrupt |
| `PWRTIME` | 24 | Time from I/O request to power up |
| `STOP_IOE` | 1 | Stop on I/O error |

Error handling is as follows:

| Error | `STOP_IOE` | Processed as |
|---|---|---|
| not attached | 1 | report error and stop |
| not attached | 0 | out of tape |
| OS I/O error | x | report error and stop |

### 316/516-33 Console Teletype (TTY)

The console Teletype (TTY) consists of four separate units:

| Unit | Function |
|---|---|
| `TTY0` | Keyboard |
| `TTY1` | Printer |
| `TTY2` | Paper tape reader |
| `TTY3` | Paper tape punch |

The keyboard and printer (`TTY0`, `TTY1`) can be set to one of four
modes, `KSR`, `7P`, `7B`, or `8B`:

| Mode | Input characters | Output characters |
|---|---|---|
| `KSR` | lower case converted to upper case, high-order bit set | lower case converted to upper case, high-order bit cleared, non-printing characters suppressed |
| `7P` | high-order bit cleared | high-order bit cleared, non-printing characters suppressed |
| `7B` | high-order bit cleared | high-order bit cleared |
| `8B` | no changes | no changes |

The default mode is KSR. The Teletype keyboard reads from the console
keyboard, and the printer writes to the simulator console window.

The paper tape reader (`TTY2`) can be set to operate in binary, ASCII,
or Unix ASCII mode:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET TTY2 BINARY` | Binary mode |
| `SET TTY2 ASCII` | ASCII mode |
| `SET TTY2 UASCII` | Unix ASCII mode |

The mode can also be set by a switch setting in the `ATTACH` command:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `ATT -B TTY2 <file>` | Binary mode |
| `ATT -A TTY2 <file>` | ASCII mode |
| `ATT -U TTY2 <file>` | Unix ASCII mode |

In ASCII or Unix ASCII mode, all non-zero characters have the high order
bit forced on. In Unix ASCII mode, newline is converted to CR, and LF is
inserted as the following character.

The paper tape reader is started by program output of `XON` or by the
command `SET TTY2 START`. The paper tape reader is stopped by reader
input of `XOFF` or by the command `SET TTY2 STOP`.

The Teletype paper tape punch (`TTY3`) can be set to operate in binary,
ASCII, or Unix ASCII mode:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET TTY3 BINARY` | Binary mode |
| `SET TTY3 ASCII` | ASCII mode |
| `SET TTY3 UASCII` | Unix ASCII mode |

The mode can also be set by a switch setting in the `ATTACH` command:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `ATT -B TTY3 <file>` | Binary mode |
| `ATT -A TTY3 <file>` | ASCII mode |
| `ATT -U TTY3 <file>` | Unix ASCII mode |

In ASCII or Unix ASCII mode, all characters are masked to 7b before
being written to the output file. In Unix ASCII mode, LF is converted to
newline, and CR is discarded.

The Teletype paper tape punch is started by program output of `TAPE` or
by the command `SET TTY3 START`. The punch is stopped by program output
of `XOFF` or by the command `SET TTY3 STOP`.

The TTY implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| `BUF` | 8 | Last data item processed |
| `IN2ND` | 9 | Holding buffer, input busy wait; the high-order bit indicates character present |
| `MODE` | 1 | Read/write mode |
| `READY` | 1 | Device ready flag |
| `BUSY` | 1 | Device busy flag |
| `INT` | 1 | Device interrupt request |
| `ENABLE` | 1 | Device interrupt enabled |
| `KPOS` | 32 | Number of keyboard characters input |
| `KTIME` | 24 | Keyboard polling interval |
| `KBTIME` | 24 | Keyboard busy wait after receive |
| `TPOS` | 32 | Number of printer characters output |
| `TTIME` | 24 | Time from I/O initiation to interrupt |
| `RPOS` | 32 | Current reader character position |
| `PPOS` | 32 | Current punch character position |

### 316/516-12 Real Time Clock (CLK)

The real time clock (`CLK`) frequency can be adjusted as follows:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET CLK 60HZ` | Set frequency to 60 Hz |
| `SET CLK 50HZ` | Set frequency to 50 Hz |

The default is 60Hz.

The clock implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| `INTREQ` | 1 | Device interrupt request |
| `READY` | 1 | Device ready |
| `ENABLE` | 1 | Device interrupts enabled |
| `TIME` | 24 | Clock interval |

The real-time clock autocalibrates; the clock interval is adjusted up or
down so that the clock tracks actual elapsed time.

Note that previous releases of SIMH did not allow the CLK device to be
disabled. However, this device was optional and it was possible to
configure an H316 system without one (although this apparently rarely
happened). Current SIMH releases allow the CLK device to be disabled.
When the CLK device is disabled it does not respond to the
clock-specific I/O instructions; it does not increment location
61<sub>8</sub>, and it does not generate interrupts. The SMK and OTK
instructions are unaffected.

## 316/516 Line Printer (LPT)

The line printer (LPT) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the printer. The default
position after `ATTACH` is to position at the end of an existing file.
A new file can be created if you attach with the `-N` switch.

The line printer can be connected to the IO bus, a DMC channel, or a DMA
channel:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET LPT IOBUS` | Connect to IO bus |
| `SET LPT DMC=n` | Connect to DMC channel `n` (1-16) |
| `SET LPT DMA=n` | Connect to DMA channel `n` (1 to 4) |

By default, the line printer is connected to the IO bus.

The line printer implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| `WDPOS` | 6 | Word position in current scan |
| `DRPOS` | 6 | Drum position |
| `CRPOS` | 1 | Carriage position |
| `PRDN` | 1 | Print-done flag |
| `RDY` | 1 | Ready flag |
| `EOR` | 1 | (DMA/DMC) end-of-range flag |
| `DMA` | 1 | Transfer using DMA/DMC |
| `INTREQ` | 1 | Device interrupt request |
| `ENABLE` | 1 | Device interrupt enable |
| `SVCST` | 2 | Service state |
| `SVCCH` | 2 | Service channel |
| `BUF` | 8 | Buffer |
| `POS` | 32 | Position in the output file |
| `XTIME` | 24 | Delay between transfers |
| `ETIME` | 24 | Delay at end of scan |
| `PTIME` | 24 | Delay for shuttle/line advance |
| `STOP_IOE` | 1 | Stop on I/O error |

Error handling is as follows:

| Error | `STOP_IOE` | Processed as |
|---|---|---|
| not attached | 1 | report error and stop |
| not attached | 0 | out of paper |
| OS I/O error | x | report error and stop |

## 4400 Fixed Head Disk (FHD)

Fixed head disk options include the ability to set the number of
surfaces to a fixed value between 1 and 16, or to autosize the number of
surfaces from the attached file:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET FHD 1S` | One surface (98K) |
| `SET FHD 2S` | Two platters (196K) |
| `...` | ... |
| `SET FHD 16S` | Sixteen surfaces (1568K) |
| `SET FHD AUTOSIZE` | Autosize on `ATTACH` |

The default is one surface.

The fixed head disk can be connected to the IO bus, a DMC channel, or a
DMA channel:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET FHD IOBUS` | Connect to IO bus |
| `SET FHD DMC=n` | Connect to DMC channel `n` (1-16) |
| `SET FHD DMA=n` | Connect to DMA channel `n` (1 to 4) |

By default, the fixed head disk is connected to the IO bus.

The fixed head disk implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| `CW1` | 16 | Control word 1 (read/write, surface, track) |
| `CW2` | 16 | Control word 2 (character address) |
| `BUF` | 16 | Data buffer |
| `BUSY` | 1 | Controller busy flag |

Error handling is as follows:

| Error | `STOP_IOE` | Processed as |
|---|---|---|
| not attached | 1 | report error and stop |
| not attached | 0 | disk not ready |

Fixed head disk data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of
file and OS I/O errors cannot occur.

## 4100 7-track Magnetic Tape (MT)

Magnetic tape options include the ability to make units write enabled or
write locked.

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET MTn LOCKED` | Set unit `n` write locked |
| `SET MTn WRITEENABLED` | Set unit `n` write enabled |

Magnetic tape units can be set to a specific reel capacity in MB, or to
unlimited capacity:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET MTn CAPAC=m` | Set unit `n` capacity to `m` MB (`0` = unlimited) |
| `SHOW MTn CAPAC` | Show unit `n` capacity in MB |

Units can also be set `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`.

The magnetic tape controller can be connected to the IO bus, a DMC
channel, or a DMA channel:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET MT IOBUS` | Connect to IO bus |
| `SET MT DMC=n` | Connect to DMC channel `n` (1-16) |
| `SET MT DMA=n` | Connect to DMA channel `n` (1 to 4) |

| `STOP_IOE` | 1 | Stop on I/O error |

Error handling is as follows:

| Error | Processed as |
|---|---|
| not attached | tape not ready; if `STOP_IOE`, stop |
| end of file | bad tape |
| OS I/O error | parity error; if `STOP_IOE`, stop |

## 4623/4651/4720 Disk Packs (DP)

The disk controller can be configured as a 4623, supporting 10-surface
disk packs; a 4651, supporting 2-surface disk packs; or a 4720,
supporting 20-surface disk packs:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET DP 4623` | Controller is 4623 |
| `SET DP 4651` | Controller is 4651 |
| `SET DP 4720` | Controller is 4720 |

The default is 4651. All disk packs on the controller must be of the same type.

Individual units can be write enabled or write locked:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET DPn LOCKED` | Set unit `n` write locked |
| `SET DPn WRITEENABLED` | Set unit `n` write enabled |

Units can also be set `ENABLED` or `DISABLED`.

The disk pack controller can be connected to a DMC channel or a DMA
channel; it cannot be connected to the IO bus:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET DP DMC=n` | Connect to DMC channel `n` (1-16) |
| `SET DP DMA=n` | Connect to DMA channel `n` (1 to 4) |

The disk pack controller supports variable track formatting. Each track
can contain between 1 and 103 records, with a minimum size of 1 word
and a maximum size of 1893 words. Record addresses are unconstrained.
The simulator provides commands to perform simple formats of a new disk:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET DPn FORMAT=k` | Format unit `n` with `k` words per record |
| `SET -R DPn FORMAT=k` | Format unit `n` with `k` records per track |

Record addresses can either be geometric (cylinder/track/sector) or
simple sequential starting from 0:

| Command | Description |
|---|---|
| `SET DPn FORMAT=k` | Format with geometric record addresses |
| `SET -S DPn FORMAT=k` | Format with sequential record addresses |

Geometric addresses have the cylinder number in bits `<1:8>`, the head
number in bits `<9:13>`, and the sector number in bits `<14:16>`.

A summary of the current format, and its validity, can be obtained with
the command `SHOW DPn FORMAT`, which displays the format of unit `n`.

To accommodate the variable formatting, each track is allocated 2048
words in the data file. A record consists of a three-word header, the
data, and a five-word trailer:

| Word(s) | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `word 0` | record length in words, not including header/trailer |
| `word 1` | record address |
| `word 2` | number of extension words used (0-4) |
| `word 3` | start of data record |
| `word 3+n-1` | end of data record |
| `word 3+n..7+n` | record trailer: up to four extension words, plus checksum |

A record can "grow" by up to four words without disrupting the track
formatting; writing more than four extra words destroys the formatting
of the rest of the track and causes a simulator error.

The disk pack controller implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| `STA` | 16 | Status |
| `BUF` | 16 | Data buffer |
| `FNC` | 4 | Controller function |
| `CW1` | 16 | Command word 1 |
| `CW2` | 16 | Command word 2 |
| `CSUM` | 16 | Record checksum |
| `BUSY` | 1 | Controller busy |
| `RDY` | 1 | Transfer ready |
| `EOR` | 1 | (DMA/DMC) end of range |
| `DEFINT` | 1 | Seek deferred interrupt pending |
| `INTREQ` | 1 | Interrupt request |
| `ENABLE` | 1 | Interrupt enable |
| `TBUF[0:2047]` | 16 | Track buffer |
| `RPTR` | 11 | Pointer to start of record in track buffer |
| `WPTR` | 11 | Pointer to current word in record |
| `BCTR` | 15 | Bit counter for formatting |
| `STIME` | 24 | Seek time, per cylinder |
| `XTIME` | 24 | Transfer time, per word |
| `BTIME` | 24 | Controller busy time |

Error handling is as follows:

| Error | Processed as |
|---|---|
| not attached | pack off line; if `STOP_IOE`, stop |
| end of file | ignored |
| OS I/O error | data error; if `STOP_IOE`, stop |

# Symbolic Display and Input

The H316/H516 simulator implements symbolic display and input. Display
is controlled by command-line switches:

| Switch | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-a` | Display as ASCII character |
| `-c` | Display as two packed ASCII characters |
| `-m` | Display instruction mnemonics |

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by
command-line switches:

| Input | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `'` or `-a` | ASCII character |
| `"` or `-c` | Two packed ASCII characters |
| alphabetic | Instruction mnemonic |
| numeric | Octal number |

Instruction input uses standard H316/H516 assembler syntax. There are
six instruction classes: memory reference, I/O, control, shift, skip,
and operate.

Memory reference instructions have the format:

```
memref{*} {C/Z} address{,1}
```

where `*` signifies indirect, `C` a current sector reference, `Z` a sector
zero reference, and 1 indexed. The address is an octal number in the
range 0 - 077777; if C or Z is specified, the address is a page offset
in the range 0 - 0777. Normally, C is not needed; the simulator figures
out from the address what mode to use. However, when referencing memory
outside the CPU, there is no valid PC, and C must be used to specify
current sector addressing.

I/O instructions have the format:

```
io function,device
```

The function is an octal number in the range 0 - 17. The device is a
symbolic name (e.g., TTY) or an octal number in the range 0-77.

Control and operate instructions consist of a single opcode:

```
opcode
```

Shift instructions have the format:

```
shift n
```

where n is an octal number in the range 0-77.

Skip instructions have the format:

```
sub-op sub-op sub-op...
```

The simulator checks that the combination of sub-opcodes is legal.
