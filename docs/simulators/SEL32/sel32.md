Most devices can be disabled or enabled with the `SET <dev> DISABLED`
and `SET <dev> ENABLED` commands, respectively. The channel address of
all devices can be configured and must be enabled before being able to
use the device. SEL32 configurations must match valid UTX or MPX
configurations.

The `LOAD` and `DUMP` commands are not implemented.

## Central Processor (CPU)

Central processor options include the CPU model, the CPU features, and
the size of main memory.

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET CPU 32/55` | set CPU model to SEL 32/55 |
| `SET CPU 32/75` | set CPU model to SEL 32/75 |
| `SET CPU 32/27` | set CPU model to SEL 32/27 |
| `SET CPU 32/67` | set CPU model to SEL 32/67 |
| `SET CPU 32/87` | set CPU model to SEL 32/87 |
| `SET CPU 32/97` | set CPU model to SEL 32/97 |
| `SET CPU V6` | set CPU model to SEL V6 |
| `SET CPU V9` | set CPU model to SEL V9 |
| `SET CPU IDLE` | set idle mode |
| `SET CPU NOIDLE` | set no idle mode |
| `SET CPU 256K` | set memory size = 256KB |
| `SET CPU 512K` | set memory size = 512KB |
| `SET CPU 1M` | set memory size = 1024KB |
| `SET CPU 2M` | set memory size = 2048KB |
| `SET CPU 3M` | set memory size = 3072KB |

| `SET CPU 12M` | set memory size = 12288KB |
| `SET CPU 16M` | set memory size = 16384KB |

If memory size is being reduced, and the memory being truncated contains
non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation. Data in the
truncated portion of memory is lost. Initial configuration is SEL 32/27
CPU with 2MB of memory. IOP at channel 0x7E00, Console at 0x7EFC, tape
at 0x1000, and disk at 0x0800. Interval Timer at 0x7F04 and Real-Time
Clock at 0x7F06.

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---|---|
| `PC` | 24 | program counter |
| `GPR[0..7]` | 32 | active general registers |
| `BR[0..7]` | 32 | active base mode registers |
| `PSD[2]` | 32 | processor status doubleword |

| `CPIXPL` | 32 | Map count for current CPIX |
| `CPIX` | 32 | Master Process list index for CPIX |
| `HIWM` | 32 | Count of maps loaded on last map load |

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions. This is controlled by the `SET CPU HISTORY` and
`SHOW CPU HISTORY` commands:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET CPU HISTORY` | clear history buffer |
| `SET CPU HISTORY=0` | disable history |
| `SET CPU HISTORY=n` | enable history, length = `n` |
| `SHOW CPU HISTORY` | print CPU history |
| `SHOW CPU HISTORY=n` | print first `n` entries of CPU history |

The maximum length for the history buffer is 10,000 entries before
wrapping around.

## Memory Mapping

Through the late 1970’s to the early 1990’s SEL computers used a variety
of memory mapping schemes. The 32/55 was the first PC board SEL
computer. Previous computers (8500/8600) had wire-wrapped backplanes to
interconnect components. The 32/55 had no memory mapping and had a .5 mb
address space. The 32/75 was the first mapped machine and had a 1 mb
address space. The 32/27 & 32/87 expanded the address space to 2 mb. The
32/67 & 32/97 had a 16 mb address space and finally the V6 & V9 added
virtual memory to the system. The CPU maintains a cache of the current
values in the map registers. Depending on the CPU type, an address space
is constructed using the current map cache. Addresses are translated if
the CPU is operating in the mapped mode. The V6 and V9 CPUs also have
demand paging traps that allow a virtual address space. The TLB
(Translation Lookaside Buffer) is used to lookup pages (maps) that are
in memory and if not resident, execute a page request trap to the O/S.
The memory map implements two types of protection when in the
unprivileged mode: quarter page write protection and page
read/write/execute access protection on virtual addresses. Following is
a summary of the mapping/protection for each CPU type:

| Name | Maps | Size | Task size | Comments |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `32/55` | 0 | 0 | 512mb | No mapping |
| `32/77` | 32 | 32kb | 1024mb | 8kb r/w protection |
| `32/27` | 256 | 8kb | 2048mb | 8kb r/w protection |
| `32/87` | 256 | 8kb | 2048mb | 8kb r/w protection |
| `32/67` | 2048 | 8kb | 16384mb | 8kb r/w protection |
| `32/97` | 2048 | 8kb | 16384mb | 8kb r/w protection |
| `V6` | 2048 | 8kb | 16384mb | 32mb r/w/x protection |
| `V9` | 2048 | 8kb | 16384mb | 32mb r/w/x protection |

## Interrupt System (INT)

The SEL32 implements a multi-level priority interrupt system, with a
maximum of 112 interrupt levels. It also maintains interrupt status and
settings in the 256 word SPAD memory maintained by the CPU and O/S
software. The `EXAMINE` command can be used to display the contents of
the INT and SPAD registers.

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `EXAMINE INT[all]` | display all INT data |
| `EXAMINE INT[6]` | display interrupt level 6 status |
| `EXAMINE SPAD[all]` | display all SPAD data |
| `EXAMINE SPAD[24]` | display word twenty-four of the SPAD |

## IOP/MFP

The IOP or MFP is an integrated controller that allows
multiple controllers to be configured. At least one IOP or MFP must be
defined for a system and have a RTC/ITM defined and a console TTY.
Optional LPR and 8-Line devices can be controlled. The MFP can also
control two SCSI disk/tape controllers.

The MFP/IOP must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET MFP enabled` | enable MFP |
| `SET IOP enabled` | enable IOP |

## IOP Console (CON)

The console terminal (CON) consists of two units. Unit 0 is for console
input, unit 1 for console output. The console shares the IOP channel
controller and interrupt.

The console attention sequence (@@A) is supported via the attention trap
at (0xB4). The trap code assigned to this trap level will determine the
action that will take place. In MPX, this is usually the operator
communications task.

The console must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET CON enabled` | enable console I/O |

By default, the console terminal is assigned to channel 0x7EFC (input)
and 0x7EFD (output). An IOP console must be defined for the simulator
to operate.

## IOP Line Printer (LPR)

The line printer is attached to the IOP at address 0x7EF8 and shares the
IOP channel controller and interrupt. The line printer (LPR) writes data
to a disk file that is attached to the LPR device. The number of lines
per page and the device address can be set.

The line printer can be assigned to a file using the following command:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `ATTACH LPR LPOUTPUT` | set output to file `lpoutput` |

The lines per page can be assigned using the following command:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET LPR LINESPERPAGE=60` | set lines per page to 60 |

The LPR device address can be assigned using the following command:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET LPR DEV=7EF8` | set device address to `7EF8` |

The LPR must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET LPR enabled` | enable line printer |

By default, the line printer is assigned to device `LP7EF8` with 66
lines per page.

## IOP Interval Timer (ITM)

The SEL32 computer implements an interval timer that can be loaded with
a down count. When the count reaches zero, the CPU will be interrupted.
The timer can optionally be set to continue down counting or reload a
preset values. The clock is started, stopped, read, and written by the
software. The count frequency can be set to 38.4us or 76.8us per clock
increment. To set the frequency:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET ITM 3840` | set count interval to 38.4us |
| `SET ITM 7680` | set count interval to 76.8us |

The current setting can be displayed by:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SHOW ITM` | show current interval-timer setting |

The ITM must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET ITM enabled` | enable interval timer |

The default address of the interval timer is 0x7F04. The default
interrupt level is 0x5f (95).

## Real-Time Clock (RTC)

The SEL32 computer implements a real-time clock. It can be set to a
variety of frequencies, 50Hz, 60Hz, 100Hz, and 120Hz. The frequency of
the clock can be adjusted as follows:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET RTC <50|60|100|120>` | set clock to the specified frequency |

The frequency of the clock can be displayed as follows:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SHOW RTC` | show current clock frequency |

The RTC must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET RTC enabled` | enable clock |

The real-time clock auto-calibrates; the clock interval is adjusted up
or down so that the clock tracks actual elapsed time. The default
address is 0x7F06. The default interrupt level is 0x18 (24).

## IOP 8-Line Asynchronous Controller (COM)

The character-oriented communications subsystem implements 8
asynchronous interfaces per controller, with modem control. The
subsystem has two controllers: COMC for the scanner and COML for the
individual lines. The terminal multiplexer performs input and output
through Telnet sessions connected to a user-specified port. The
`ATTACH` command specifies the port to be used:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `ATTACH COMC <port>` | set up telnet listening port |

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities. Non-root users will require the port
to be 1024-65535.

The COMC operates in ASCII. Each line (each unit of COML) supports four
character processing modes: UC, 7P, 7B, and 8B.

| Mode | Input characters | Output characters |
|---|---|---|
| `UC` | high-order bit cleared, lower case converted to upper case | high-order bit cleared, lower case converted to upper case |
| `7P` | high-order bit cleared | high-order bit cleared, non-printing characters suppressed |
| `7B` | high-order bit cleared | high-order bit cleared |
| `8B` | no changes | no changes |

The COMC controller must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET COMC enabled` | enable communications controller |

The serial lines can be individually enabled/disabled and must be
enabled to be active. Set active by:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET COMLn enabled` | enable serial line |

The default is `7P`. In addition, each line supports output logging. The
`SET COMLn LOG` command enables logging on a line:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET COMLn LOG=filename` | log output of line `n` to `filename` |

The `SET COMLn NOLOG` command disables logging and closes the open log
file, if any.

Once COMC is attached and enabled and the simulator is running, the
multiplexer listens for connections on the specified port. It assumes
that the incoming connections are Telnet connections. The connections
remain open until disconnected by the Telnet client, a
`SET COMC DISCONNECT` command, or a `DETACH COMC` command.

Other special multiplexer commands:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SHOW COMC CONNECTIONS` | show current connections |
| `SHOW COMC STATISTICS` | show statistics for active connections |
| `SET COMLn DISCONNECT` | disconnect the specified line |

The terminal multiplexer does not support save and restore. All open
connections are lost when the simulator shuts down or COMC is detached.
By default, the multiplexer is assigned to IOP channel `0x7E00` at
devices `0x7EA0`-`0x7EAF`.

##  2311/2314 UDP Disk Processors (DMA, DMB)

The SEL-32 simulator can support up to two F-class moving head disk
controllers (DMA, DMB). Each controller can control up to 8 disk drives.
Drives can be assigned as 768 byte sectors for MPX or as 1024 byte
sectors for UTX. Drives defined within the SEL-32 simulator must match
the drive that was defined by the sysgen command file. The UTX model
number must match one of the drive numbers supported by UTX. UTX drives
are specified by drive number, and MPX by MHXXX type. All drives on a
controller must be UTX or MPX with 768 or 1024 byte sectors. Drives on
the controller can be mixed by size.

The UDP disk must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET DMA enabled` | enable UDP disk |

Use the following command to attach a specific drive:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET DMA0 TYPE=MH300` | set MPX drive to 768 byte 300MB disk |
| `SET DMA0 TYPE=9344` | set UTX drive to 1024 byte 300MB disk |

The default for DMA0 is MH300 with 768 byte sectors with 300MB capacity.

The command to set a drive to a particular model is:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET DMAn TYPE=<drive_type>` | set unit `n` to the specified drive type |

By default, DMA is assigned to channel `0x0800`, and DMB is assigned to
channel `0x0C00`.

##  8064 High Speed Disk Processor (DPA, DPB)

The SEL-32 simulator can support up to two F-class High Speed Disk
Processors (DPA, DPB). Each controller can control up to 8 disk drives.
Drives can be assigned as 768 byte sectors for MPX or as 1024 byte
sectors for UTX. Drives defined within the SEL-32 simulator must match
the drive that was defined for the SYSGEN command file. The UTX model
number must match one of the drive numbers supported by UTX that is
specified when the disk is prepped using the PREP utility. UTX drives
are specified by drive number, and MPX by MHXXX type. All drives on a
controller must be UTX or MPX with 768 or 1024 byte sectors. Drives on
the controller can be mixed by size.

The HSDP disk must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET DPA enabled` | enable DPA HSDP disk |

##  SCFI SCSI Disk Controller(SDA, SDB)

The SEL-32 simulator can support up to two F-class SCFI SCSI Disk
controllers (SDA, SDB). Each controller can control up to 8 disk drives.
Drives can be assigned as 768 byte sectors for MPX. Drives defined within
the SEL-32 simulator must match the drive that was defined by the SYSGEN
command file. UTX does not support this disk controller, only MPX-32.
MPX drives are specified by `SGXXX`, `SDXXX`, or `MH1GB` type. All
drives on a controller must be MPX with 768 byte sectors. Drives on the
controller can be mixed by size.

Use the following command to attach a specific drive:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET SDA0 TYPE=SG120` | set MPX drive to 768 byte 1200MB disk |

The SCFI disk must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

| Command | Action |

## MFP SCSI Disk/Tape Controller(SBA, SBB)

The SEL-32 simulator can support up to two SCSI BUS controllers (SBA,
SBB). Each controller can control up to 2 units. Drives can be
assigned as 768 byte sectors for MPX or as 1024 byte sectors for UTX.
Drives defined within the SEL-32 simulator must match the drive that was
defined by the sysgen command file. The UTX model number must match one
of the drive numbers supported by UTX. UTX drives are specified by drive
number, and MPX by SXXXX type. All drives on a controller must be UTX or
MPX with 768 or 1024 byte sectors. Drives on the controller can be mixed
by size. The MFP device must be enabled to be able to use the MFP SCSI
disks.

The MFP SCSI disk must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET SBA enabled` | enable SBA SCSI disk |
| `SET SBB enabled` | enable SBB SCSI disk |

Use the following command to attach a specific drive:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET SBA0 TYPE=SD300` | set MPX drive to 768 byte 300MB disk |
| `SET SBA0 TYPE=8821` | set UTX drive to 1024 byte 300MB disk |

The default for SBA0 is `SD150` with 768 byte sectors and 150MB
capacity.

The following drives can be configured:

| Model | Heads | Sectors/Track | Sect/Cyl | Cylinders | Size |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `8820` | 9 | 18 | 162 | 967 | 150MB |
| `8821` | 9 | 36 | 324 | 967 | 300MB |
| `8833` | 18 | 20 | 360 | 1546 | 700MB |
| `8835` | 18 | 20 | 360 | 1931 | 1200MB |
| `SD150` | 9 | 24 | 162 | 967 | 150MB |
| `SD300` | 9 | 32 | 288 | 1409 | 300MB |
| `SD700` | 15 | 35 | 525 | 1546 | 700MB |
| `SD1200` | 15 | 49 | 735 | 1931 | 1200MB |
| `SD2400` | 19 | 59 | 1026 | 2707 | 2400MB |
| `SH1200` | 15 | 50 | 750 | 1872 | 1200MB |
| `SH2550` | 19 | 55 | 1045 | 2707 | 2550MB |
| `SH5150` | 21 | 83 | 1745 | 3711 | 5150MB |

The command to set a drive to a particular model is:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET SBAn TYPE=<drive_type>` | set unit `n` to the specified drive type |

By default, SBA and SBB are assigned under channel `0x7600`, with unit
0 at device addresses `0x7600` and `0x7640`, respectively. These device
addresses can be changed with the `SET SBAn DEV=...` command.

## 8051 Buffered Tape Processor (MTA & MTB)

The magnetic tape controller supports up to eight units. MT options
include the ability to make units write enabled or write locked.

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET MTAn LOCKED` | set unit `n` write locked |
| `SET MTAn WRITEENABLED` | set unit `n` write enabled |

Magnetic tape units can be set to a specific reel capacity in MB, or to
unlimited capacity:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET MTBn CAPAC=m` | set unit `n` capacity to `m` MB (`0` = unlimited) |
| `SHOW MTBn CAPAC` | show unit `n` capacity in MB |

The tape processor must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET MTA enabled` | enable MTA tape controller |
| `SET MTB enabled` | enable MTB tape controller |

Units can also be set ENABLED or DISABLED. The magnetic tape controller
supports the `BOOT` command. `BOOT MTn` simulates the standard console
fill sequence for unit `n`.

By default, the magnetic tape is assigned to channel `0x1000` but can
be changed with the `SET MTA0 DEV=1800` command.

## 8516 Ethernet Controller

The Ethernet controller allows the user to connect to the internet. The
`SetupNet` script in the `tests` directory allows the network device to
be created on the host system. A MAC address may be defined, or a
default one can be used. The Ethernet device can be connected to the
local network
using the following directive:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `ATTACH EC TAP:TAP0` | attach to tap port on host |

The transmission mode (0-2) can be set using the following directive:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET EC MODE=n` | set mode to 0, 1, or 2 |

The MAC address can be set with the following directive:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET EC MAC=XX:XX:XX:XX:XX:XX` | set MAC address |

The Ethernet controller must be enabled for it to be active. Set active by:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET EC enabled` | enable Ethernet controller |

By default, the Ethernet controller is assigned to channel `0x0e00`,
but this can be changed with the `SET EC DEV=0e00` command. For UTX,
the mode needs to be set to `MODE=2`, and the `SET EC MAC=` command
should not be used.

# Symbolic Display

The SEL-32 simulator implements symbolic display and input when using
the `EXAMINE` command. Display is controlled by command line switches:

| Switch | Action |
|---|---|
| `-a` | display as ASCII character (byte addressing) |
| `-b` | display as byte (byte addressing) |
| `-o` | display as octal value |
| `-d` | display as decimal |
| `-h` | display as hexadecimal |
| `-m` | display base register instruction mnemonics |
| `-n` | display non-base register instruction mnemonics |

# Diagnostics for SEL-32 Simulator

The operation of the SEL-32 simulator can be verified using the standard
SEL diagnostic suite. It is provided in the `tests` directory. The
command file `sel32_test.ini` is run after compilation of the simulator
by the `makefile`. It uses the diagnostic tape file `diag.tap`. On the
tape is another diagnostic command file that runs each of the
diagnostics automatically. The default CPU is the `32/27`. The file
`diag.ini` can be edited to start different simulator configurations and
test them using the `diag.tap` file as input.

Run the diagnostic with:

```
./sel32 diag.ini
```

Output will be to the user terminal and also the `sel.log` file.
