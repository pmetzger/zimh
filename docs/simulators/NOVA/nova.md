# Nova Features

The Nova simulator is configured as follows:

| Device names | Simulates |
|---|---|
| `CPU` | Nova, Nova 3, Nova 4 CPU with 32KW of memory, or Keronix CPU with 64KW of memory |
|  | hardware multiply/divide |
| `PTR,PTP` | paper tape reader/punch |
| `TTI,TTO` | console terminal |
| `TTI1,TTO1` | second terminal |
| `LPT` | line printer |
| `PLT` | plotter |
| `RTC` | real-time clock |
| `DSK` | head-per-track disk controller |
| `DKP` | moving head disk controller with four drives |
| `MTA` | magnetic tape controller with eight drives |
| `QTY` | 4060 multiplexer with up to 64 lines |
| `ALM` | 4255 multiplexer with up to 64 lines |

The Nova simulator implements these unique stop conditions:

- Reference to undefined I/O device, and STOP_DEV is set

- More than INDMAX indirect addresses are detected during an interrupt

- More than INDMAX indirect addresses are detected during memory reference address decoding

Note that indirect address loop detection does not exist on unmapped
Novas. Some DG diagnostics test thousands of levels of indirect
addressing. INDMAX may have to be set to 32,000 to get diagnostics to
run properly.

The `LOAD` command supports standard binary format tapes. The `DUMP`
command is not implemented.

All devices except TTI can be disabled or enabled with these commands:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET <dev> DISABLED` | Disable the device |
| `SET <dev> ENABLED` | Enable the device |

All devices except QTY are enabled by default.

## CPU

The only CPU options are the presence of the optional instructions and
the size of main memory.

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET CPU MDV` | Enable multiply/divide |
| `SET CPU EXT64KW` | Enable extended 64KW memory mode |
| `SET CPU NOVA3` | Set Nova 3 CPU |
| `SET CPU NOVA4` | Set Nova 4 CPU |
| `SET CPU KERONIX` | Set Keronix CPU |
| `SET CPU NONE` | Disable all optional instructions |
| `SET CPU 4K` | Set memory size to 4K |
| `SET CPU 8K` | Set memory size to 8K |
| `SET CPU 12K` | Set memory size to 12K |
| `SET CPU 16K` | Set memory size to 16K |
| `SET CPU 20K` | Set memory size to 20K |
| `SET CPU 24K` | Set memory size to 24K |
| `SET CPU 28K` | Set memory size to 28K |
| `SET CPU 32K` | Set memory size to 32K |
| `SET CPU 36K` | Set memory size to 36K |
| `SET CPU 40K` | Set memory size to 40K |
| `SET CPU 44K` | Set memory size to 44K |
| `SET CPU 48K` | Set memory size to 48K |
| `SET CPU 52K` | Set memory size to 52K |
| `SET CPU 56K` | Set memory size to 56K |
| `SET CPU 60K` | Set memory size to 60K |
| `SET CPU 64K` | Set memory size to 64K |

(MDV = unsigned multiply/divide instructions)

(Nova 3 = unsigned multiply/divide, stack, trap instructions)

(Nova 4 = unsigned and signed multiply/divide, stack, byte,
trap instructions)

(Keronix = unsigned multiply/divide, extended 64KW mode)

If memory size is being reduced, and the memory being truncated contains
non-zero data, the simulator asks for confirmation. Data in the
truncated portion of memory is lost. Initial memory size is 32K.

The CPU supports the `BOOT` command. `BOOT CPU` simulates the Nova
hardware APL (automatic program load) feature. The switch register (SR) bits
12:17 must contain the device code of the device to be booted. If the
device is a "high-speed" (channel) device, SR bit 0 should also be set.

CPU registers include the visible state of the processor as well as the
control registers for the interrupt system.

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `PC` | 15 | program counter |
| `AC0..AC3` | 16 | accumulators 0..3 |
| `C` | 1 | carry |
| `SR` | 16 | front panel switches |
| `PI` | 16 | priority interrupt mask |
| `ION` | 1 | interrupt enable |
| `ION_DELAY` | 1 | interrupt enable delay for `ION` |
| `PWR` | 1 | power fail interrupt |
| `INT` | 15 | interrupt pending flags |
| `BUSY` | 15 | device busy flags |
| `DONE` | 15 | device done flags |
| `DISABLE` | 15 | device interrupt disable flags |
| `STOP_DEV` | 1 | stop on undefined IOT |
| `INDMAX` | 16 | maximum number of nested indirects |
| `PCQ[0:63]` | 15 | PC prior to last JMP, JMS, or interrupt; most recent PC change first |
| `WRU` | 8 | interrupt character |

The CPU can maintain a history of the most recently executed
instructions. This is controlled by the `SET CPU HISTORY` and
`SHOW CPU HISTORY` commands:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET CPU HISTORY` | Clear the history buffer |
| `SET CPU HISTORY=0` | Disable history |
| `SET CPU HISTORY=n` | Enable history, length = `n` |
| `SHOW CPU HISTORY` | Print CPU history |
| `SHOW CPU HISTORY=n` | Print first `n` entries of CPU history |

The maximum length for the history is 65536 entries.

## Programmed I/O Devices

### Paper Tape Reader (PTR)

The paper tape reader (PTR) reads data from a disk file. The POS
register specifies the number of the next data item to be read. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the reader.

The paper tape reader implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `BUF` | 8 | last data item processed |
| `BUSY` | 1 | device busy flag |
| `DONE` | 1 | device done flag |
| `DISABLE` | 1 | interrupt disable flag |
| `INT` | 1 | interrupt pending flag |
| `POS` | 32 | position in the input file |
| `TIME` | 24 | time from I/O initiation to interrupt |
| `STOP_IOE` | 1 | stop on I/O error |

Error handling is as follows:

| Error | `STOP_IOE` | Processed as |
|---|---:|---|
| not attached | 1 | report error and stop |
| not attached | 0 | out of tape |
| end of file | 1 | report error and stop |
| end of file | 0 | out of tape |
| OS I/O error | x | report error and stop |

### Paper Tape Punch (PTP)

The paper tape punch (PTP) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the punch.

The paper tape punch implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `BUF` | 8 | last data item processed |
| `BUSY` | 1 | device busy flag |
| `DONE` | 1 | device done flag |
| `DISABLE` | 1 | interrupt disable flag |
| `INT` | 1 | interrupt pending flag |
| `POS` | 32 | position in the output file |
| `TIME` | 24 | time from I/O initiation to interrupt |
| `STOP_IOE` | 1 | stop on I/O error |

Error handling is as follows:

| Error | `STOP_IOE` | Processed as |
|---|---:|---|
| not attached | 1 | report error and stop |
| not attached | 0 | out of tape |
| OS I/O error | x | report error and stop |

### Terminal Input (TTI)

The terminal input polls the console keyboard for input. Terminal input
options include the ability to set ANSI mode or limited Dasher
compatibility mode:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET TTI ANSI` | Set normal mode |
| `SET TTI DASHER` | Set Dasher mode |

Setting either TTI or TTO changes both devices. In Dasher mode, carriage
return is changed to newline on input, and ^X is changed to backspace.

The terminal input implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `BUF` | 8 | last data item processed |
| `BUSY` | 1 | device busy flag |
| `DONE` | 1 | device done flag |
| `DISABLE` | 1 | interrupt disable flag |
| `INT` | 1 | interrupt pending flag |
| `POS` | 32 | number of characters input |
| `TIME` | 24 | keyboard polling interval |

### Terminal Output (TTO)

The terminal output writes to the simulator console window. Terminal
output options include the ability to set ANSI mode or limited Dasher
compatibility mode:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET TTI ANSI` | Set normal mode |
| `SET TTI DASHER` | Set Dasher mode |

Setting either TTI or TTO changes both devices. In Dasher mode, carriage
return is changed to newline on input, and ^X is changed to backspace.

The terminal output implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `BUF` | 8 | last data item processed |
| `BUSY` | 1 | device busy flag |
| `DONE` | 1 | device done flag |
| `DISABLE` | 1 | interrupt disable flag |
| `INT` | 1 | interrupt pending flag |
| `POS` | 32 | number of characters output |
| `TIME` | 24 | time from I/O initiation to interrupt |

### Line Printer (LPT)

The line printer (LPT) writes data to a disk file. The POS register
specifies the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by
changing POS, the user can backspace or advance the printer. The default
position after ATTACH is to position at the end of an existing file. A
new file can be created if you attach with the -N switch.

The line printer implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `BUF` | 8 | last data item processed |
| `BUSY` | 1 | device busy flag |
| `DONE` | 1 | device done flag |
| `DISABLE` | 1 | interrupt disable flag |
| `INT` | 1 | interrupt pending flag |
| `POS` | 32 | position in the output file |
| `TIME` | 24 | time from I/O initiation to interrupt |
| `STOP_IOE` | 1 | stop on I/O error |

Error handling is as follows:

| Error | `STOP_IOE` | Processed as |
|---|---:|---|
| not attached | 1 | report error and stop |
| not attached | 0 | out of paper |
| OS I/O error | x | report error and stop |

### Real-Time Clock (RTC)

The real-time clock (RTC) line frequency can be adjusted as follows:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET RTC 60HZ` | Set line frequency to 60Hz |
| `SET RTC 50HZ` | Set line frequency to 50Hz |

The default is 60Hz.

The clock implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `SELECT` | 2 | selected clock interval |
| `BUSY` | 1 | device busy flag |
| `DONE` | 1 | device done flag |
| `DISABLE` | 1 | interrupt disable flag |
| `INT` | 1 | interrupt pending flag |
| `TIME0` | 24 | clock frequency, select = 0 |
| `TIME1` | 24 | clock frequency, select = 1 |
| `TIME2` | 24 | clock frequency, select = 2 |
| `TIME3` | 24 | clock frequency, select = 3 |

The real-time clock autocalibrates; the clock interval is adjusted up or
down so that the clock tracks actual elapsed time.

### Plotter (PLT)

The plotter (PLT) writes data to a disk file. The POS register specifies
the number of the next data item to be written. Thus, by changing POS,
the user can backspace or advance the plotter.

The plotter implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `BUF` | 8 | last data item processed |
| `BUSY` | 1 | device busy flag |
| `DONE` | 1 | device done flag |
| `DISABLE` | 1 | interrupt disable flag |
| `INT` | 1 | interrupt pending flag |
| `POS` | 32 | position in the output file |
| `TIME` | 24 | time from I/O initiation to interrupt |
| `STOP_IOE` | 1 | stop on I/O error |

Error handling is as follows:

| Error | `STOP_IOE` | Processed as |
|---|---:|---|
| not attached | 1 | report error and stop |
| not attached | 0 | out of paper |
| OS I/O error | x | report error and stop |

### Second Terminal (TTI1, TTO1)

The second terminal consists of two independent devices, TTI1 and TTO1.
The additional terminal performs input and output through a Telnet
session connecting into a user-specified port. The `ATTACH` command
specifies the port to be used:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `ATTACH TTI1 <port>` | Set up listening port |

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities.

Once TTI1 is attached and the simulator is running, the terminal listens
for a connection on the specified port. It assumes that the incoming
connection is a Telnet connection. The connection remains open until
disconnected by the Telnet client, or by a DETACH TTI1 command.

The second terminal has two options, recognized on both devices, for
setting limited Dasher-compatibility mode or ANSI mode:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET TTI1 ANSI` | Set normal mode |
| `SET TTI1 DASHER` | Set Dasher mode |
| `SET TTO1 ANSI` | Set normal mode |
| `SET TTO1 DASHER` | Set Dasher mode |

Setting either TTI1 or TTO1 changes both devices. In Dasher mode,
carriage return is changed to newline on input, and ^X is changed to
backspace. TTO1 supports output logging. The `SET TTO1 LOG` command
enables logging:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET TTO1 LOG=filename` | Log output to `filename` |

The SET TTO1 NOLOG command disables logging and closes the open log
file, if any.

Other special TTI1 commands:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SHOW TTI1 CONNECTIONS` | Show current connections |
| `SHOW TTI1 STATISTICS` | Show statistics for active connections |
| `SET TTO1 DISCONNECT` | Disconnect the line |

The second terminal input implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `BUF` | 8 | last data item processed |
| `BUSY` | 1 | device busy flag |
| `DONE` | 1 | device done flag |
| `DISABLE` | 1 | interrupt disable flag |
| `INT` | 1 | interrupt pending flag |
| `TIME` | 24 | keyboard polling interval |

The second terminal output implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `BUF` | 8 | last data item processed |
| `BUSY` | 1 | device busy flag |
| `DONE` | 1 | device done flag |
| `DISABLE` | 1 | interrupt disable flag |
| `INT` | 1 | interrupt pending flag |
| `TIME` | 24 | time from I/O initiation to interrupt |

### Asynchronous Multiplexers (QTY, ALM)

The QTY and ALM are terminal multiplexers with up to 64 lines. Either
the QTY or ALM can be enabled, but not both; the ALM is enabled by
default. The number of lines can be changed with the command:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET {QTY|ALM} LINES=n` | Set line count to `n` |

The line count maximum is 64.

The QTY and ALM support 8-bit input and output of characters. 8-bit I/O
may be incompatible with certain operating systems; 7-bit is the
default. The command

```
SET {QTY|ALM} 8B
```

enables 8-bit input and output.

The terminal lines perform input and output through Telnet sessions
connected to a user-specified port. The `ATTACH` command specifies the
port to be used:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `ATTACH {-am} {QTY|ALM} <port>` | Set up listening port |

where port is a decimal number between 1 and 65535 that is not being
used for other TCP/IP activities. For the ALM multiplexer, the optional
switch -m turns on the multiplexer modem controls; the optional switch
-a turns on active disconnects (disconnect session if computer clears
Data Terminal Ready). The QTY multiplexer does not support modem
control. Without modem control, the multiplexer behaves as though
terminals were directly connected; disconnecting the Telnet session does
not cause any operating system-visible change in line status.

Once the multiplexer is attached and the simulator is running, it
listens for connections on the specified port. It assumes that the
incoming connections are Telnet connections. The connection remains open
until disconnected by the simulated program, the Telnet client, a SET
{QTY\|ALM} DISCONNECT command, or a DETACH {QTY\|ALM} command.

Other special QTY/ALM commands:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SHOW {QTY|ALM} CONNECTIONS` | Show current connections |
| `SHOW {QTY|ALM} STATISTICS` | Show statistics for active connections |
| `SET {QTY|ALM} DISCONNECT=n` | Disconnect the specified line |

The QTY/ALM implement these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `BUF` | 8 | character buffer |
| `BUSY` | 1 | device busy flag |
| `DONE` | 1 | device done flag |
| `DISABLE` | 1 | device disable flag |
| `INT` | 1 | interrupt pending flag |
| `MDMCTL` | 1 | modem control flag |
| `AUTODS` | 1 | autodisconnect flag |
| `POLLS` | 32 | number of service polls |
| `STOP_IOE` | 1 | stop on I/O error |

The multiplexers do not support save and restore. All open connections
are lost when the simulator shuts down or the multiplexer is detached.

## Fixed Head Disk (DSK)

Fixed head disk options include the ability to set the number of
platters to a fixed value between 1 and 8, or to autosize the number of
platters from the attached file:

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET DSK 1P` | One platter (256K) |
| `SET DSK 2P` | Two platters (512K) |
| `SET DSK 3P` | Three platters (768K) |
| `SET DSK 4P` | Four platters (1024K) |
| `SET DSK 5P` | Five platters (1280K) |
| `SET DSK 6P` | Six platters (1536K) |
| `SET DSK 7P` | Seven platters (1792K) |
| `SET DSK 8P` | Eight platters (2048K) |
| `SET DSK AUTOSIZE` | Autosize on `ATTACH` |

The default is 1P (minimum size). The fixed head disk controller
supports the BOOT command.

The fixed head disk controller implements these registers:

| Name | Size | Comments |
|---|---:|---|
| `STAT` | 16 | status |
| `DA` | 16 | disk address |
| `MA` | 16 | memory address |
| `BUSY` | 1 | device busy flag |
| `DONE` | 1 | device done flag |
| `DISABLE` | 1 | device disable flag |
| `INT` | 1 | interrupt pending flag |
| `WLK` | 8 | write lock switches |
| `TIME` | 24 | rotational delay, per sector |
| `STOP_IOE` | 1 | stop on I/O error |

Error handling is as follows:

| Error | `STOP_IOE` | Processed as |
|---|---:|---|
| not attached | 1 | report error and stop |
| not attached | 0 | disk not ready |

Fixed head disk data files are buffered in memory; therefore, end of
file and OS I/O errors cannot occur.

## Moving Head Disk (DKP)

or write locked, and to select the type of drive (or autosize):

| Command | Action |
|---|---|
| `SET DKPn LOCKED` | Set unit `n` write locked |

# Symbolic Display and Input

The Nova simulator implements symbolic display and input. Display is
controlled by command line switches:

| Switch | Action |
|---|---|
| `-a` | Display as ASCII character |
| `-c` | Display as two packed ASCII characters |
| `-m` | Display instruction mnemonics |

Input parsing is controlled by the first character typed in or by
command line switches:

| Input | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `'` or `-a` | ASCII character |
| `"` or `-c` | Two packed ASCII characters |
| alphabetic | instruction mnemonic |
| numeric | octal number |

Instruction input uses standard Nova assembler syntax. There are three
instruction classes: memory reference, IOT, and operate.

Memory reference instructions have the format:

```
memref {ac,}{@}address{,index}
```

LDA and STA require an initial register; ISZ, DSZ, JSR, and JMP do not.
The syntax for addresses and indices is as follows:

| Syntax | Mode | Displacement | Comments |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `0 <= n < 0400` | 0 | `n` |  |
| `{+/-}n >= 0400` | 1 | `{+/-}n` | PC must be in range `[-200, 177]`; invalid on disk |
| `.+/-n` | 1 | `{+/-}n` | must be in range `[-200, 177]` |
| `{+/-}n,2` | 2 | `{+/-}n` | must be in range `[-200, 177]` |
| `{+/-}n,3` | 3 | `{+/-}n` | must be in range `[-200, 177]` |

IOT instructions have one of four formats:

| Syntax | Example |
|---|---|
| `iot` | `HALT` |
| `iot reg` | `INTA` |
| `iot device` | `SKPDN` |
| `iot reg,device` | `DOAS` |

Devices may be specified as mnemonics or as numbers in the range 0 - 077.

Operate instructions have the format:

```
opcode{#} reg,reg{,skip}
```

In all Nova instructions, blanks may be substituted for commas as field
delimiters.
