# Overview

SIMH (history simulators) is a set of portable programs, written in C,
which simulate various historically interesting computers. This
document describes how to design, write, and check out a new simulator
for SIMH. It is not an introduction to either the philosophy or
external operation of SIMH, and the reader should be familiar with
both of those topics before proceeding. Nor is it a guide to the
internal design or operation of SIMH, except insofar as those areas
interact with simulator design. Instead, this manual presents and
explains the form, meaning, and operation of the interfaces between
simulators and the SIMH simulator control package. It also offers some
suggestions for utilizing the services SIMH offers and explains the
constraints that all simulators operating within SIMH will experience.

Some terminology: Each simulator consists of a standard *simulator
control package* (SCP and related libraries), which provides a control
framework and utility routines for a simulator; and a unique *virtual
machine* (VM), which implements the simulated processor and selected
peripherals. A VM consists of multiple *devices*, such as the CPU,
paper tape reader, disk controller, etc. Each controller consists of a
named state space (called *registers*) and one or more *units*. Each
unit consists of a numbered state space (called a *data set*). The
*host computer* is the system on which SIMH runs; the *target
computer* is the system being simulated.

SIMH is unabashedly based on the MIMIC simulation system, designed in
the late 1960’s by Len Fehskens, Mike McCarthy, and Bob Supnik. This
document is based on MIMIC’s published interface specification, “How
to Write a Virtual Machine for the MIMIC Simulation System”, by Len
Fehskens and Bob Supnik.

# Data Types

SIMH is written in C. The host system must support (at least) 32-bit
data types (64-bit data types for the PDP-10 and other large-word
target systems). To cope with the vagaries of C data types, SIMH
defines some unambiguous data types for its interfaces:

| SIMH data type        | Interpretation in typical 32-bit C           |
|-----------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `int8`, `uint8`       | `signed char`, `unsigned char`               |
| `int16`, `uint16`     | `signed short`, `unsigned short`             |
| `int32`, `uint32`     | `signed int`, `unsigned int`                 |
| `t_int64`, `t_uint64` | `long long`, `_int64` (system specific)      |
| `t_addr`              | simulated address, `uint32` or `t_uint64`    |
| `t_value`             | simulated value, `uint32` or `t_uint64`      |
| `t_svalue`            | simulated signed value, `int32` or `t_int64` |
| `t_mtrlnt`            | mag tape record length, `uint32`             |
| `t_stat`              | status code, `int`                           |
| `t_bool`              | true/false value, `int`                      |

\[The inconsistency in naming `t_int64` and `t_uint64` is due to Microsoft
VC++, which uses `int64` as a structure name member in the master
Windows definitions file.\]

In addition, SIMH defines structures for each of its major data elements:

| Name     | Description                   |
|----------|-------------------------------|
| `DEVICE` | device definition structure   |
| `UNIT`   | unit definition structure     |
| `REG`    | register definition structure |
| `MTAB`   | modifier definition structure |
| `CTAB`   | command definition structure  |
| `DEBTAB` | debug table entry structure   |

# VM Organization

A virtual machine (VM) is a collection of devices bound together
through their internal logic. Each device is named and corresponds
more or less to a hunk of hardware on the real machine; for example:

| VM device | Real machine hardware                       |
|-----------|---------------------------------------------|
| `CPU` | central processor and main memory                  |
| `PTR` | paper tape reader controller and paper tape reader |
| `TTI` | console keyboard                                   |
| `TTO` | console output                                     |
| `DKP` | disk pack controller and drives                    |

There may be more than one device per physical hardware entity, as for
the console; but for each user-accessible device there must be at
least one. One of these devices will have the pre-eminent
responsibility for directing simulated operations. Normally, this is
the CPU, but it could be a higher-level entity, such as a bus master.

The VM actually runs as a subroutine of the simulator control package
(SCP). It provides a master routine for running simulated programs and
other routines and data structures to implement SCP’s command and
control functions. The interfaces between a VM and SCP are relatively
few:

| Interface                | Function                                                |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `char sim_name[]`        | simulator name string                                   |
| `REG *sim_PC`            | pointer to simulated program counter                    |
| `int32 sim_emax`         | maximum number of words in an instruction or data item  |
| `DEVICE *sim_devices[]`  | table of pointers to simulated devices, `NULL` terminated |
| `const char *sim_stop_messages[SCPE_BASE]` | table of pointers to error messages |
| `t_stat sim_load(…)`   | binary loader subroutine                                |
| `t_stat sim_instr(void)` | instruction execution subroutine                        |
| `t_stat parse_sym(…)`  | symbolic instruction/data parse subroutine              |
| `t_stat fprint_sym(…)` | symbolic instruction/data print subroutine              |

In addition, there are several optional interfaces, which can be used for special situations, such as GUI implementations:

| Interface                        | Function                           |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| `t_addr (*sim_vm_parse_addr)(…)` | pointer to address parsing routine |
| `void (*sim_vm_fprint_addr)(…) ` | pointer to address output routine  |
| `void (*sim_vm_sprint_addr)(…) ` | pointer to address format routine  |
| `char (*sim_vm_read)(…)`         | pointer to command input routine   |
| `void (*sim_vm_post)(…)` | pointer to command post-processing routine |
| `t_bool (*sim_vm_fprint_stopped)(…)` | pointer to stop message format routine |
| `t_value (*sim_vm_pc_value)(…)` | pointer to routine returning the VM PC value |
| `t_bool (*sim_vm_is_subroutine_call)(…)` | pointer to routine that determines if the current<br>instruction is a subroutine call|
| `const char *sim_vm_release` | pointer to string specifying the simulator specific<br>release version |
| `CTAB *sim_vm_cmd` | pointer to simulator-specific command table |

There is no required organization for VM code. The following
convention has been used so far. Let `name` be the name of the real
system (i1401 for the IBM 1401; i1620 for the IBM 1620; pdp1 for the
PDP-1; pdp18b for the other 18-bit PDP’s; pdp8 for the PDP-8; pdp11
for the PDP-11; nova for Nova; hp2100 for the HP 21XX; h316 for the
Honeywell 315/516; gri for the GRI-909; pdp10 for the PDP-10; vax for
the VAX; sds for the SDS-940):

Then, substituting in an appropriate *name* for `name`:

| File            | Contents                                                 |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `name.h`        | Definitions for the particular simulator                 |
| `name_sys.c`    | All the SCP interfaces except the instruction simulator  |
| `name_cpu.c`    | The instruction simulator and CPU data structures        |
| `name_stddev.c` | The peripherals which were standard with the real system |
| `name_lp.c`     | Line printer                                             |
| `name_mt.c`     | Mag tape controller and drives, etc.                     |

The SIMH standard definitions are in `sim_defs.h`. Most definitions
required by a VM can be obtained simply by including that file. A few
require additional header files; those are called out below. The base
components of SIMH are:

| Source Module   | Header File     | Module                                  |
|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------|
| `scp.c`         | `scp.h`         | control package                         |
| `sim_console.c` | `sim_console.h` | terminal I/O library                    |
| `sim_fio.c`     | `sim_fio.h`     | file I/O library                        |
| `sim_timer.c`   | `sim_timer.h`   | timer library                           |
| `sim_sock.c`    | `sim_sock.h`    | socket I/O library                      |
| `sim_ether.c`   | `sim_ether.h`   | Ethernet I/O library                    |
| `sim_serial.c`  | `sim_serial.h`  | Serial Port I/O library                 |
| `sim_tmxr.c`    | `sim_tmxr.h`    | terminal multiplexer simulation library |
| `sim_disk.c`    | `sim_disk.h`    | disk simulation library                 |
| `sim_tape.c`    | `sim_tape.h`    | magtape simulation library              |

## CPU Organization

Most CPUs perform at least the following functions:

- Time keeping
- Instruction fetching
- Address decoding
- Execution of non-I/O instructions
- I/O command processing
- Interrupt processing

Instruction execution is actually the least complicated part of the
design; memory and I/O organization should be tackled first.

### Time Base

In order to simulate asynchronous events, such as I/O completion, the
VM must define and keep a time base. This can be accurate (for
example, nanoseconds of execution) or arbitrary (for example, number
of instructions executed), but it must be used consistently throughout
the VM. Many existing VMs count time in instructions, some count time
in cycles that may align with cycles in the original hardware that may
reflect different instructions and/or combinations of memory
references.

The CPU is responsible for counting down the event counter
`sim_interval` and calling the asynchronous event controller
`sim_process_event`. SCP does the record keeping for timing.

SCP will display pending events or other activities and report the
number these event times reflect using the string
`sim_vm_interval_units`. The `sim_vm_interval_units` defaults to
“instructions”, but the simulator may change this to “cycles” if the
simulator tracks machine state updates internally based on cycles.

A simulator’s time base needs to be specifically considered when
writing simulated devices. The correct choice that a `DEVICE` may use
depends on not only the sim_interval decrement strategy, but also the
nature of how long the `DEVICE` being simulated completed various
activities actually being simulated.

Usually, `DEVICE`s simulate some physical interaction that the CPU
made with mechanical components (tape drives, card readers, disk
drives, etc.) The time required for activities on these mechanical
devices was many times the instruction execution rate of the processor
(hundreds of times, thousands of times, or even more).

A `DEVICE` author usually chooses `DEVICE` delays that are something
between:

1. The amount of `sim_interval` decrements that relates to how long
   the activities on that particular `DEVICE` actually took.

2.  The absolute minimum that software (operating systems,
    applications, or diagnostics) running within the simulator were
    capable of receiving a completion notification for the particular
    `DEVICE` activity.

The absolute minimum case would often reflect that the software in
question (device driver, or other) may setup some sort of I/O to the
device, but not actually be prepared to realize the operation’s
completion one instruction after whatever the CPU did to initiate the
operation (for instance the interrupt handler for device’s I/O
completion).

It probably would have been smarter if the original software author
established the interrupt handler before initiating the I/O activity,
but real hardware never responded in one instruction time, so that
software always worked on hardware. Since the goal of the simulation
is to have the simulator work with existing software, the `DEVICE`
simulation should reflect this goal. This minimum value is usually
observed during `DEVICE` simulator development and thus adjusted by
the failure of such software.

### Step Function

SCP implements a stepping function using the `STEP` command. `STEP` counts
down a specified number of time units (as described in section 3.1.1)
and then stops simulation. The VM can override the `STEP` command’s
counts by calling routine `sim_cancel_step`:

- `t_stat sim_cancel_step(void)` – cancel `STEP` count down.

The VM can then inspect variable `sim_step` to see if a `STEP` command
is in progress. If `sim_step` is non-zero, it represents the number of
steps to execute. The VM can count down `sim_step` using its own
counting method, such as cycles, instructions, or memory
references. If the VM counts steps in units other than instructions,
it can set the `sim_vm_step_unit` string pointer to reflect this.

### Memory Organization

The criterion for memory layout is very simple: use the SIMH data type
that is as large as (or if necessary, larger than), the word length of
the real machine. Note that the criterion is word length, not
addressability: the PDP-11 has byte addressable memory, but it is a
16-bit machine, and its memory is defined as `uint16 M[]`. It may seem
tempting to define memory as a union of `int8` and `int16` data types, but
this would make the resulting VM endian-dependent. Instead, the VM
should be based on the underlying word size of the real machine, and
byte manipulation should be done explicitly. Examples:

| Simulator        | Memory Size | Memory Declaration |
|------------------|-------------|--------------------|
| IBM 1620         | 5-bit       | `uint8`            |
| IBM 1401         | 7-bit       | `uint8`            |
| PDP-8            | 12-bit      | `uint16`           |
| PDP-11, Nova     | 16-bit      | `uint16`           |
| PDP-1            | 18-bit      | `uint32`           |
| VAX              | 32-bit      | `uint32`           |
| PDP-10, IBM 7094 | 36-bit      | `t_uint64`         |

### Interrupt Organization

The design of the VM’s interrupt structure is a complex interaction
between efficiency and fidelity to the hardware. If the VM’s interrupt
structure is too abstract, interrupt driven software may not run. On
the other hand, if it follows the hardware too literally, it may
significantly reduce simulation speed.

One rule I can offer is to minimize the fetch-phase cost of
interrupts, even if this complicates the (much less frequent)
evaluation of the interrupt system following an I/O operation or
asynchronous event. Another is not to over-generalize; even if the
real hardware could support 64 or 256 interrupting devices, the
simulators will be running much smaller configurations. I’ll start
with a simple interrupt structure and then offer suggestions for
generalization.

In the simplest structure, interrupt requests correspond to device
flags and are kept in an interrupt request variable, with one flag per
bit. The fetch-phase evaluation of interrupts consists of two steps:
are interrupts enabled, and is there an interrupt outstanding? If all
the interrupt requests are kept as single-bit flags in a variable, the
fetch-phase test is very fast:

```c
if (int_enable && int_requests) { /*…process interrupt…*/ }
```

Indeed, the interrupt enable flag can be made the highest bit in the
interrupt request variable, and the two tests combined:

```c
if (int_requests > INT_ENABLE) { /*…process interrupt…*/ }
```

Setting or clearing device flags directly sets or clears the
appropriate interrupt request flag:

```c
/*set:*/    int_requests = int_requests | DEVICE_FLAG;
/*clear:*/  int_requests = int_requests & ~DEVICE_FLAG;
```

At a slightly higher complexity, interrupt requests do not correspond
directly to device flags but are based on masking the device flags
with an enable (or disable) mask. There are now two parallel
variables: device flags and interrupt enable mask. The fetch-phase
test is now:

```c
if (int_enable && (dev_flags & int_enables)) { /*…process interrupt…*/ }
```

As a next step, the VM may keep a summary interrupt request variable,
which is updated by any change to a device flag or interrupt
enable/disable:

```c
/*enable:*/  int_requests = device_flags & int_enables;
/*disable:*/ int_requests = device_flags & ~int_disables;
```

This simplifies the fetch phase test slightly.

At yet higher complexity, the interrupt system may be too complex or
too large to evaluate during the fetch-phase. In this case, an
interrupt pending flag is created, and it is evaluated by subroutine
call whenever a change could occur (start of execution, I/O
instruction issued, device time out occurs). This makes fetch-phase
evaluation simple and isolates interrupt evaluation to a common
subroutine.

If required for interrupt processing, the highest priority
interrupting device can be determined by scanning the interrupt
request variable from high priority to low until a set bit is
found. The bit position can then be back-mapped through a table to
determine the address or interrupt vector of the interrupting device.

### I/O Dispatching

I/O dispatching consists of four steps:

- Identify the I/O command and analyze for the device address.
- Locate the selected device.
- Break down the I/O command into standard fields.
- Call the device processor.

Analyzing an I/O command is usually easy. Most systems have one or
more explicit I/O instructions containing an I/O command and a device
address. Memory mapped I/O is more complicated; the identification of
a reference to I/O space becomes part of memory addressing. This
usually requires centralizing memory reads and writes into
subroutines, rather than as inline code.

Once an I/O command has been analyzed, the CPU must locate the device
subroutine. The simplest way is a large switch statement with
hardwired subroutine calls. More modular is to call through a dispatch
table, with `NULL` entries representing non-existent devices; this also
simplifies support for modifiable device addresses and configurable
devices. Before calling the device routine, the CPU usually breaks
down the I/O command into standard fields. This simplifies writing the
peripheral simulator.

### Instruction Execution

Instruction execution is the responsibility of VM subroutine
`sim_instr`. It is called from SCP as a result of a RUN, GO,
CONT, or BOOT command. It begins executing instructions at the
current PC (`sim_PC` points to its register description block) and
continues until halted by an error or an external event.

When called, the CPU needs to account for any state changes that the
user made. For example, it may need to re-evaluate whether an
interrupt is pending, or restore frequently used state to local
register variables for efficiency. The actual instruction fetch and
execute cycle is usually structured as a loop controlled by an error
variable, e.g.,

```c
reason = 0;
do { /*…*/ } while (reason == 0);
```

or

```c
while (reason == 0) { /*…*/ }
```

Within this loop, the usual order of events is:

- If the event timer `sim_interval` has reached zero, process any
  timed events. This is done by SCP subroutine
  `sim_process_event`. Because this is the polling mechanism for
  user-generated processor halts (^E), errors must be recognized
  immediately:

```c
if (sim_interval <= 0) {
    if (reason = sim_process_event ()) break; }
```

- Check for outstanding interrupts and process if required.

- Check for other processor-unique events, such as wait-state
  outstanding or traps outstanding.

- Check for an instruction breakpoint. SCP has a comprehensive
  breakpoint facility. It allows a VM to define many different kinds
  of breakpoints. The VM checks for execution (type E) breakpoints
  during instruction fetch.

- Fetch the next instruction, increment the PC, optionally decode the
  address, and dispatch (via a switch statement) for execution.

A few guidelines for implementation:

- In general, code should reflect the hardware being simulated. This
  is usually simplest and easiest to debug.

- The VM should provide some debugging aids. The existing CPUs all
  provide multiple instruction breakpoints, a PC change queue, error
  stops on invalid instructions or operations, and symbolic
  examination and modification of memory.

## Peripheral Device Organization

The basic elements of a VM are devices, each corresponding roughly to
a real chunk of hardware. A device consists of register-based state
and one or more units. Thus, a multi-drive disk subsystem is a single
device (representing the hardware of the real controller) and one or
more units (each representing a single disk drive). Sometimes the
device and its unit are the same entity as, for example, in the case
of a paper tape reader. However, a single physical device, such as the
console, may be broken up for convenience into separate input and
output devices.

In general, units correspond to individual sources of input or output
(one tape transport, one A-to-D channel). Units are the basic medium
for both device timing and device I/O. Except for the console,
terminals, and network devices, all other I/O devices are simulated as
host-resident files. SCP allows the user to make an explicit
association between a host-resident file and a simulated hardware
entity.

Both devices and units have state. Devices operate on *registers*,
which contain information about the state of the device, and
indirectly, about the state of the units. Units operate on *data
sets*, which may be thought of as individual instances of input or
output, such as a disk pack or a punched paper tape. In a typical
multi-unit device, all units are the same, and the device performs
similar operations on all of them, depending on which one has been
selected by the program being simulated.

(Note: SIMH, like MIMIC, restricts registers to devices. Replicated
registers, for example, disk drive current state, are handled via
register arrays.)

For each structural level, SIMH defines, and the VM must supply, a
corresponding data structure. `DEVICE` structures correspond to
devices, `REG` structures to registers, and `UNIT` structures to
units. These structures are described in detail in section 4.

The primary functions of a peripheral are:

- command decoding and execution
- device timing
- data transmission.

Command decoding is fairly obvious. At least one section of the
peripheral code module will be devoted to processing directives issued
by the CPU. Typically, the command decoder will be responsible for
register and flag manipulation, and for issuing or canceling I/O
requests. The former is easy, but the latter requires a thorough
understanding of device timing.

### Device Timing

The principal problem in I/O device simulation is imitating
asynchronous operations in a sequential simulation
environment. Fortunately, the timing characteristics of most I/O
devices do not vary with external circumstances.

The distinction between devices whose timing is externally generated
(e.g., console keyboard) and those whose timing is internally
generated (disk, paper tape reader) is crucial. With an externally
timed device, there is no way to know when an in-progress operation
will begin or end; with an internally timed device, given the time
when an operation starts, the end time can be calculated.

For an internally timed device, the elapsed time between the start and
conclusion of an operation is called the wait time. Some typical
internally timed devices and their wait times include:

| Device | Rate           | Wait Time |
|--------|----------------|-----------|
| `PTR`  | 300 char/sec   | 3.3 msec  |
| `PTP`  | 50 char/sec    | 20 msec   |
| `CLK`  | line frequency | 16.6 msec |
| `TTO`  | 30 char/sec    | 33 msec   |

Mass storage devices, such as disks and tapes, do not have a fixed
response time, but a start-to-finish time can be calculated based on
current versus desired position, state of motion, etc.

For an externally timed device, there is no portable mechanism by
which a VM can be notified of an external event (for example, a key
stroke). Accordingly, all current VMs poll for keyboard input, thus
converting the externally timed keyboard to a pseudo-internally timed
device. A more general restriction is that SIMH is
single-threaded. Threaded operations must be done by polling using the
unit timing mechanism, either with real units or fake units created
expressly for polling.

SCP provides the supporting routines for device timing. SCP maintains
a list of units (called active units) that are in the process of
timing out. It also provides routines for querying or manipulating
this list (called the active queue). Lastly, it provides a routine for
checking for timed-out units and executing a VM-specified action when
a time-out occurs.

Device timing is done with the `UNIT` structure, described in
section 4. To set up a timed operation, the peripheral calculates a
waiting period for a unit and places that unit on the active
queue. The CPU counts down the waiting period. When the waiting period
has expired, `sim_process_event` removes the unit from the active
queue and calls a device subroutine. A device may also cancel an
outstanding timed operation and query the state of the queue. The
timing subroutines are:

- `t_stat sim_activate(UNIT *uptr, int32 wait)`. This routine places
  the specified unit on the active queue with the specified waiting
  period. A waiting period of 0 is legal; negative waits cause an
  error. If the unit is already active, the active queue is not
  changed, and no error occurs.

- `t_stat sim_activate_abs(UNIT *uptr, int32 wait)`. This routine
  places the specified unit on the active queue with the specified
  waiting period. A waiting period of 0 is legal; negative waits cause
  an error. If the unit is already active, the specified waiting
  period overrides the currently pending waiting period.

- `t_stat sim_activate_after(UNIT *uptr, uint32 usec_delay)`. This
  routine places the specified unit on the active queue with the
  specified delay based on the simulator’s calibrated clock. The
  specified delay must be greater than 0 usecs. If the unit is already
  active, the active queue is not changed, and no error occurs.

- `t_stat sim_activate_after_d(UNIT *uptr, double usec_delay)`. This
  routine places the specified unit on the active queue with the
  specified delay based on the simulator’s calibrated clock. The
  specified delay must be greater than 0 usecs. If the unit is already
  active, the active queue is not changed, and no error occurs.

- `t_stat sim_activate_after_abs(UNIT *uptr, uint32 usec_delay)`. This
  routine places the specified unit on the active queue with the
  specified delay based on the simulator’s calibrated clock. The
  specified delay must be greater than 0 usecs. If the unit is already
  active, the specified delay overrides the currently pending waiting
  period.

- `t_stat sim_activate_after_abs_d(UNIT *uptr, double usec_delay)`.
  This routine places the specified unit on the active queue with the
  specified delay based on the simulator’s calibrated clock. The
  specified delay must be greater than 0 usecs. If the unit is already
  active, the specified delay overrides the currently pending waiting
  period.

- `t_stat sim_cancel(UNIT *uptr)`. This routine removes the specified
  unit from the active queue. If the unit is not on the queue, no
  error occurs.

- `t_bool sim_is_active(UNIT *uptr)`. This routine tests whether a unit
  is in the active queue. If it is, the routine returns `TRUE`; if it
  is not, the routine returns `FALSE`.

- `int32 sim_activate_time(UNIT *uptr)`. This routine returns the time the device has remaining in the queue + 1. If it is not pending, the routine returns 0.

- `double sim_activate_time_usecs(UNIT *uptr)`. This routine returns
  the wall clock time in usecs the device has remaining in the
  queue + 1. If the unit is not pending, the routine returns 0.

- `double sim_gtime(void)`. This routine returns the time elapsed since
  the last RUN or BOOT command.

- `uint32 sim_grtime(void)`. This routine returns the low-order 32b of
  the time elapsed since the last RUN or BOOT command.

- `int32 sim_qcount(void)`. This routine returns the number of entries
  on the clock queue.

- `t_stat sim_process_event(void)`. This routine removes all timed out
  units from the active queue and calls the appropriate device
  subroutine to service the time-out.

- `int32 sim_interval`. This variable represents the time until the
  first unit on the event queue that is scheduled to
  happen. `sim_inst` counts down this value (usually by 1 for each
  instruction executed). If there are no timed events outstanding, SCP
  counts down a “null interval” of 10,000 time units.

### Clock Calibration

The timing mechanism described in the previous section is
approximate. Devices, such as real-time clocks, which track wall time
will be inaccurate. SCP provides routines to synchronize multiple
simulated clocks (to a maximum of 8) to wall time.

- `int32 sim_rtcn_init_unit_ticks(UNIT *uptr, int32 clock_interval,
  int32 clk, int32 ticksper)`. This routine initializes the clock
  calibration mechanism for simulated clock `clk` and `uptr`
  identifies which unit’s service routine performs clock tick
  activities. The argument `clock_interval` is returned as the
  result. The ticksper argument specifies the clock ticks per second.

- `int32 sim_rtcn_init_unit(UNIT *uptr, int32 clock_interval, int32
  clk, int32 ticksper)`. This routine initializes the clock
  calibration mechanism for simulated clock `clk` and `uptr`
  identifies which unit’s service routine performs clock tick
  activities. The argument `clock_interval` is returned as the result.

- `int32 sim_rtcn_calb(int32 tickspersecond, int32 clk)`. This routine
  calibrates simulated clock `clk`. The argument is the number of
  clock ticks expected per second. The return value is the calibrated
  interval for the next tick.

- `int32 sim_rtcn_calb_tick(int32 clk)`. This routine calibrates
  simulated clock `clk`. The return value is the calibrated interval
  for the next tick.

Some host computers have relatively poor resolution clock ticks (\>=
10ms) and/or variable or high minimum sleep times (\> 2ms). Some
simulators have clocks which may need to tick faster than the clock
resolution or minimum sleep times. In order to provide accurate time
services, a simulator should notify the timing services that the
simulated system has digested a previously generated clock tick.

- `t_stat sim_rtcn_tick_ack(int32 delay, int32 clk)`. This routine
  informs the timing subsystem that the most recent clock tick for the
  simulated clock has been digested by the simulated system and the
  timing subsystem can potentially schedule a catchup ticks if
  necessary. If a catchup clock tick is necessary, the `delay` value
  indicates how soon the tick can be generated.

The VM must call `sim_rtcn_init_unit_ticks` for each simulated clock
in two places: in the reset routine of the `DEVICE` which implements a
clock device (All reset routines are executed at simulator startup and
when a `DEVICE` is enabled or disabled) and whenever the real-time clock
is started. The simulator calls `sim_rtcn_calb` to calculate the
actual interval delay when the real-time clock is serviced:

```c
/* clock start */

if (!sim_is_active(&clk_unit))
    sim_activate(&clk_unit, sim_rtcn_init_unit_ticks (&clk_unit, clk_delay, clkno, clk_ticks_per_second));

/* etc. *

/* clock service */

sim_rtcn_calb_tick(clkno);
sim_activate_after(&clk_unit, 1000000/clk_ticks_per_second);

/* clock register access */

sim_rtcn_tick_ack(20, clkno);
```

The real-time clock is usually simulated clock 0; other clocks are
used for polling asynchronous multiplexers or intervals timers.

The underlying timer services will automatically run a calibrated
clock whenever the simulator doesn’t have one registered and running
or when the registered timer is running too fast for accurate clock
calibration.. This will allow the `sim_activate_after` API to provide
proper wall clock relative timing delays.

Some simulated systems use programmatic interval timers to implement
clock ticks. If a simulated system or simulated operating system uses
a constant interval to provide the system clock ticks, then clock
device is a candidate to be a calibrated timer. If the simulated
operating system dynamically changes the programmatic interval more
than once, then such a device is not a calibrated timer, but it
certainly should use `sim_activate_after` and `sim_activate_time` to
implement the programmatic interval delays.

### Pre-Calibration

Some simulator situations expect that instruction execution rates be
immediately close to the rate that the host system is capable of
executing instructions at and for wall clock delays to be immediately
precise. The simulator framework provides a means of pre-calibrating
the instruction execution rate. A sequence of three to four
instructions that run in a tight loop can be used at simulator startup
time to compute the execution rate.

The following line in and around the CPU device reset routine will
serve to facilitate the precalibration:

```c
static const char *vax_clock_precalibrate_commands[] = {
    "-m 100 INCL 120",
    "-m 103 INCL 124",
    "-m 106 MULL3 120,124,128",
    "-m 10D BRW 100",
    "PC 100",
    NULL};

t_stat cpu_reset (DEVICE *dptr)
{
    sim_clock_precalibrate_commands = vax_clock_precalibrate_commands;
    sim_vm_initial_ips = SIM_INITIAL_IPS;
    /*...*/

}
```

Once pre-calibration has been done, some wall clock delays on some
(very slow) host systems may be unreasonably off with respect to
actual instruction execution. To accommodate for this the simulator
may provide an initial expectation of how fast it can execute the
pre-calibration instruction loop. This estimate can be specified by
the simulator in the CPU device reset routine. An appropriate value
for the `sim_vm_initial_ips` is best determined by comparing the VAX
simulator pre-calibrated result (displayed in the SHOW CLOCK command)
to your simulator’s pre-calibrated value. If your value is
approximately N times the VAX’s value, then `sim_vm_initial_ips`
should be set to N times `SIM_INITIAL_IPS`.

### Idling

Idling is a way of pausing simulation when no real work is happening,
without losing clock calibration. The VM must detect when it is idle;
it can then inform the host of this situation by calling `sim_idle`:

- `t_bool sim_idle(int32 clk, int tick_decrement)` – attempt to idle
  the VM until the next scheduled I/O event, using simulated clock
  `clk` as the time base, and decrement `sim_interval` by an
  appropriate number of cycles. If a calibrated timer is not
  available, or the time until the next event is less than 1ms,
  decrement `sim_interval` by `tick_decrement`; otherwise, leave
  `sim_interval` unchanged.

`sim_idle` returns `TRUE` if the VM actually idled, `FALSE` if it did not.

In order for idling to be well behaved on the host system, simulated
devices which poll for input (console and terminal multiplexors are
examples), the polling that these devices perform should be done at
the same time as when the simulator will unavoidably be executing
instructions. The most common time this happens is when clock tick
interrupts are generated. As such, these devices should schedule their
polling activities to be aligned with the clock ticks which are
happening anyway or some multiple of the clock tick value.

- `t_stat sim_clock_coschedule(UNIT *uptr, int32 interval)` – This
  routine places the specified unit on the active queue behind the
  default timer at the specified interval rounded up to a whole number
  of timer ticks. An interval value 0 is legal; negative intervals
  cause an error. If the unit is already active, the active queue is
  not changed, and no error occurs.

- `t_stat sim_clock_coschedule_abs(UNIT *uptr, int32 interval)` – This
  routine places the specified unit on the active queue behind the
  default timer at the specified interval rounded up to a whole number
  of timer ticks. An interval value 0 is legal; negative intervals
  cause an error. If the unit is already active, the specified waiting
  period overrides the currently pending waiting period.

- `t_stat sim_clock_coschedule_tmr(UNIT *uptr, int32 tmr, int32 ticks)` –
  This routine places the specified unit on the active queue
  behind the specified timer with the specified number of clock ticks
  between invocations. A tick count of 0 is legal; negative ticks
  cause an error. If the unit is already active, the active queue is
  not changed, and no error occurs. Events scheduled for 0 or 1 tick
  will fire on the next clock tick.

- `t_stat sim_clock_coschedule_tmr_abs(UNIT *uptr, int32 tmr, int32 ticks)` –
  This routine places the specified unit on the active queue behind
  the specified timer with the specified number of clock ticks between
  invocations. A tick count of 0 is legal; negative ticks cause an
  error. If the unit is already active, the specified waiting period
  overrides the currently pending waiting period. Events scheduled for
  0 or 1 tick will fire on the next clock tick.

Because idling and throttling are mutually exclusive, the VM must
inform SCP when idling is turned on or off:

- `t_stat sim_set_idle(UNIT *uptr, int32 val, const char *cptr, void *desc)` –
  informs SCP that idling is enabled.

- `t_stat sim_clr_idle(UNIT *uptr, int32 val, const char *cptr, void *desc)` –
  informs SCP that idling is disabled.

- `t_stat sim_show_idle(FILE *st, UNIT *uptr, int32 val, const void *desc)` –
  displays whether idling is enabled or disabled, as seen by SCP.

### Data I/O

For most devices, timing is half the battle (for clocks it is the
entire war); the other half is I/O. Some devices are simulated on real
hardware (for example, Ethernet controllers). Most I/O devices are
simulated as files on the host file system in little-endian
format. SCP provides facilities for associating files with units
(ATTACH command) and for reading and writing data from and to devices
in a endian- and size-independent way.

For most devices, the VM designer does not have to be concerned about
the formatting of simulated device files. I/O occurs in 1, 2, 4, or 8
byte quantities; SCP automatically chooses the correct data size and
corrects for byte ordering. Specific issues:

- Line printers should write data as 7-bit ASCII, with newlines
  replacing carriage-return/line-feed sequences.

- Disks should be viewed as linear data sets, from sector 0 of surface
  0 of cylinder 0 to the last sector on the disk. This allows easy
  transcription of real disks to files usable by the simulator.

- Magtapes, by convention, use a record based format. Each record
  consists of a leading 32-bit record length, the record data (padded
  with a byte of 0 if the record length is odd), and a trailing 32-bit
  record length. File marks are recorded as one record length of 0.

- Cards have 12 bits of data per column, but the data is most
  conveniently viewed as (ASCII) characters. Column binary can be
  implemented using two successive characters per card column.

Data I/O varies between fixed and variable capacity devices, and
between buffered and non-buffered devices. A fixed capacity device
differs from a variable capacity device in that the file attached to
the former has a maximum size, while the file attached to the latter
may expand indefinitely. A buffered device differs from a non-buffered
device in that the former buffers its data set in host memory, while
the latter maintains it as a file. Most variable capacity devices
(such as the paper tape reader and punch) are sequential; all buffered
devices are fixed capacity.

#### Reading and Writing Data

The ATTACH command creates an association between a host file and an
I/O unit. For non-buffered devices, ATTACH stores the file pointer for
the host file in the `fileref` field of the `UNIT` structure. For
buffered devices, ATTACH reads the entire host file into a buffer
pointed to by the `filebuf` field of the `UNIT` structure. If unit flag
`UNIT_MUSTBUF` is set, the buffer is allocated dynamically; otherwise,
it must be statically allocated.

For non-buffered devices, I/O is done with standard C subroutines plus
the SCP routines `sim_fread` and `sim_fwrite`. `sim_fread` and
`sim_fwrite` are identical in calling sequence and function to `fread`
and `fwrite`, respectively, but will correct for endian
dependencies. For buffered devices, I/O is done by copying data to or
from the allocated buffer. The device code must maintain the number
(+1) of the highest address modified in the `hwmark` field of the `UNIT`
structure. For both the non-buffered and buffered cases, the device
must perform all address calculations and positioning operations.

SIMH provides capabilities to access files \>2GB (the `int32` position
limit). If a VM is compiled with flags `USE_INT64` and `USE_ADDR64`
defined, then `t_addr` is defined as `t_uint64` rather than
`uint32`. Routine `sim_fseek` allows simulated devices to perform random
access in large files:

- `int sim_fseek(FILE *handle, t_addr position, int where)` -
  sim_fseek is identical to standard C `fseek`, with two exceptions:
  `where = SEEK_END` is not supported, and the position argument can be
  64b wide.

The DETACH command breaks the association between a host file and an
I/O unit. For buffered devices, DETACH writes the allocated buffer
back to the host file.

#### Console I/O

SCP provides three routines for console I/O.

- `t_stat sim_poll_kbd(void)`. This routine polls for keyboard
  input. If there is a character, it returns `SCPE_KFLAG` + the
  character. If the console is attached to a Telnet connection, and
  the connection is lost, the routine returns `SCPE_LOST`. If there is
  no input, it returns `SCPE_OK`.

- `t_stat sim_putchar(int32 char)`. This routine types the specified
  ASCII character to the console. If the console is attached to a
  Telnet connection, and the connection is lost, the routine returns
  `SCPE_LOST`.

- `t_stat sim_putchar_s(int32 char)`. This routine outputs the
  specified ASCII character to the console. If the console is attached
  to a Telnet connection, and the connection is lost, the routine
  returns `SCPE_LOST`; if the connection is backlogged, the routine
  returns `SCPE_STALL` and the output should retried at a later time.

#### Simulators for computers without a console port

If a computer being simulated doesn’t have a console port SCP will
call `sim_poll_kbd` periodically to detect when a user types ^E (Control
E) in the session running the simulator and they will be returned to
the `sim>` prompt.

# Data Structures

The devices, units, and registers that make up a VM are formally
described through a set of data structures which interface the VM to
the control portions of SCP. The devices themselves are pointed to by
the device list array `sim_devices[]`. Within a device, both units
and registers are allocated contiguously as arrays of structures. In
addition, many devices allow the user to set or clear options via a
modifications table.

Note that a device must always have at least one unit, even if that
unit is not needed for simulation purposes. A device that does not
need registers need not provide a register table, instead the
registers field is set to `NULL`.

Device registers serve two purposes:

1. Provide a means of letting the simulator user (more often the
   developer) have visibility to examine and potentially change
   arbitrary state variables within the simulator from the `sim>`
   prompt rather than having to use a debugger.
2. Provide *all* of the information in the internal state of a
   simulated device so that a `SAVE` command can capture that state
   and a subsequent `RESTORE` (after exiting and restarting the same
   simulator) will be able to proceed without any information being
   missing.

A device unit serves two fundamental purposes in a simulator:

1. It acts as an entity which can generate events which are handled in
   the simulated instruction stream (via one of the `sim_activate` APIs)
2. It provides a place which holds an open file pointer for simulated
   devices which have content bound to file contents (via `ATTACH`
   commands).

For example: A `UNIT` can be mapped to real units in a simulated device
(i.e. disk drives), or it might serve merely to perform timing related
activities, or both of these might be present. The `pdp11_rq`
simulation has a combination of both of these. There are four units
which map one to one directly to simulated disk drives, and there are
two additional units. One is used to time various things and one is
used to provide instruction delays while walking through the MSCP
initialization and command processing sequence.

## DEVICE Structure

Devices are defined by the `DEVICE` structure (`typedef DEVICE`):

```c
struct DEVICE {
    const char    *name;              /* name */
    struct UNIT   *units;             /* units */
    struct REG    *registers;         /* registers */
    struct MTAB   *modifiers;         /* modifiers */
    int32         numunits;           /* #units */
    uint32        aradix;             /* address radix */
    uint32        awidth;             /* address width */
    uint32        aincr;              /* addr increment */
    uint32        dradix;             /* data radix */
    uint32        dwidth;             /* data width */
    t_stat        (*examine)();       /* examine routine */
    t_stat        (*deposit)();       /* deposit routine */
    t_stat        (*reset)();         /* reset routine */
    t_stat        (*boot)();          /* boot routine */
    t_stat        (*attach)();        /* attach routine */
    t_stat        (*detach)();        /* detach routine */
    void          *ctxt;              /* context */
    uint32        flags;              /* flags */
    uint32        dctrl;              /* debug control flags */
    struct DEBTAB *debflags;          /* debug flag names */
    t_stat        (*msize)();         /* memory size change */
    char          *lname;             /* logical name */
    t_stat        (*help)();          /* help routine */
    t_stat        (*attach_help)();   /* attach help routine */
    void          *help_ctxt;         /* help context */
    const char    *(*description)();  /* device description */
};
```

The fields are the following:

- `name` device name, string of all capital alphanumeric characters.
- `units` pointer to array of `UNIT` structures, or `NULL` if none.
- `registers` pointer to array of `REG` structures, or `NULL` if none.
- `modifiers` pointer to array of `MTAB` structures, or `NULL` if none.
- `numunits` number of units in this device.
- `aradix` radix for input and display of device addresses, 2 to 16
  inclusive.
- `awidth` width in bits of a device address, 1 to 64 inclusive.
- `aincr` increment between device addresses, normally 1; however,
  byte addressed devices with 16-bit words specify 2, with 32-bit
  words 4.
- `dradix` radix for input and display of device data, 2 to 16
  inclusive.
- `dwidth` width in bits of device data, 1 to 64 inclusive.
- `examine` address of special device data read routine, or `NULL` if
  none is required.
- `deposit` address of special device data write routine, or `NULL` if
  none is required.
- `reset` address of device reset routine, or `NULL` if none is
  required.
- `boot` address of device bootstrap routine, or `NULL` if none is
  required.
- `attach` address of special device attach routine, or `NULL` if none
  is required.
- `detach` address of special device detach routine, or `NULL` if none
  is required.
- `ctxt` address of VM-specific device context table, or `NULL` if
  none is required.
- `flags` device flags.
- `dctrl` debug control flags.
- `debflags` pointer to array of DEBTAB structures, or `NULL` if none.
- `msize` address of memory size change routine, or `NULL` if none is
  required.
- `lname` pointer to logical name string, or `NULL` if not assigned.
- `help` address of help routine, or `NULL` if none is required.
- `attach_help` address of attach help routine, or `NULL` if none is
  required.
- `help_ctx` address of device specific context which might be useful
  while displaying help for the current device, or `NULL` if none is
  required.
- `description` address of device description function, or `NULL` if
  not implemented. The function returns a string which displays the a
  description of the device being simulated. This is part of the
  output of the "SHOW FEATURES" command. It also is available (when
  provided) for dynamic insertion in the information produced by the
  `DEVICE` help routine.

### Awidth and Aincr

The `awidth` field specifies the width of the VM’s fundamental
computer “word”. For example, on the PDP-11, `awidth` is 16b, even
though memory is byte-addressable. The `aincr` field specifies how
many addressing units comprise the fundamental “word”. For example, on
the PDP-11, `aincr` is 2 (2 bytes per word).

If `aincr` is greater than 1, SCP assumes that data is naturally
aligned on addresses that are multiples of `aincr`. VM’s that support
arbitrary byte alignment of data (like the VAX) can follow one of two
strategies:

- Set `width = 8` and `aincr = 1` and support only byte access in the
  examine/deposit routines.
- Set `awidth` and `aincr` to the fundamental sizes and support
  unaligned data access in the examine/deposit routines.

In a byte-addressable VM, `SAVE` and `RESTORE` will require
`(memory_size_bytes / aincr)` iterations to save or restore
memory. Thus, it is significantly more efficient to use word-wide
rather than byte-wide memory; but requirements for unaligned access
can add significantly to the complexity of the examine and deposit
routines.

### Device Flags

The `flags` field contains indicators of current device status. SIMH
defines several flags:

| flag name      | meaning if set                                             |
|----------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `DEV_DISABLE`  | device can be set enabled or disabled                      |
| `DEV_DIS`      | device is currently disabled                               |
| `DEV_DYNM`     | device requires call on `msize` routine to change memory size |
| `DEV_DEBUG`    | device supports SET DEBUG command                          |
| `DEV_SECTORS`  | device capacity is in units of 512 byte sectors            |
| `DEV_DONTAUTO` | do not automatically detach already attached units         |
| `DEV_FLATHELP` | use traditional (unstructured) help                        |
| `DEV_NOSAVE`   | don’t save device state                                    |

The flags field also contains an optional device type
specification. One of these may be specified when initializing the
flags field:

| flag name     | meaning if set                       |
|---------------|--------------------------------------|
| `DEV_DISK`    | device uses sim_disk library attach  |
| `DEV_TAPE`    | device uses sim_tape library attach  |
| `DEV_MUX`     | device uses sim_tmxr library attach  |
| `DEV_ETHER`   | device uses sim_ether library attach |
| `DEV_DISPLAY` | device uses sim_video library attach |

Starting at bit position `DEV_V_UF` up to but not including
`DEV_V_RSV`, the remaining flags are device-specific. Device flags are
automatically saved and restored; the device need not supply a
register for these bits.

### Context

The field contains a pointer to a VM-specific device context table, if
required. SIMH never accesses this field. The context field allows
VM-specific code to walk VM-specific data structures from the
`sim_devices` root pointer.

### Examine and Deposit Routines

For devices which maintain their data sets as host files, SCP
implements the examine and deposit data functions. However, devices
which maintain their data sets as private state (for example, the CPU)
must supply special examine and deposit routines. The calling
sequences are:

- `t_stat examine_routine(t_val *eval_array, t_addr addr, UNIT
  *uptr, int32 switches)` – Copy `sim_emax` consecutive addresses for
  unit `uptr`, starting at `addr`, into `eval_array`. The `switch`
  variable has bit\<n\> set if the n’th letter was specified as a
  switch to the examine command.

- `t_stat deposit_routine(t_val value, t_addr addr, UNIT *uptr,
  int32 switches)` – Store the specified `value` in the specified
  `addr` for unit `uptr`. The `switch` variable is the same as for the
  examine routine.

### Reset Routine

The reset routine implements the device reset function for the `RESET`,
`RUN`, and `BOOT` commands. Its calling sequence is:

- `t_stat reset_routine(DEVICE *dptr)` – Reset the specified device to
  its initial state.

A typical reset routine clears all device flags and cancels any
outstanding timing operations. Switch `-p` (available via global
variable `sim_switches`) specifies a reset to power-up state.

The reset routine is a reasonable place to perform one time
initialization activities specific to the device keeping a static
variable indicating that the one time initialization has been
performed.

### Boot Routine

If a device responds to a `BOOT` command, the boot routine implements
the bootstrapping function. Its calling sequence is:

- `t_stat boot_routine(int32 unit_num, DEVICE *dptr)` – Bootstrap unit
  `unit_num` on the device `dptr`.

A typical bootstrap routine copies a bootstrap loader into main memory
and sets the PC to the starting address of the loader. SCP then starts
simulation at the specified address.

### Attach and Detach Routines

Normally, the `ATTACH` and `DETACH` commands are handled by
SCP. However, devices which need to pre- or post-process these
commands must supply special attach and detach routines. The calling
sequences are:

- `t_stat attach_routine(UNIT *uptr, const char *file)` – Attach the
  specified `file` to the unit `uptr`.

`sim_switches` contains the command switch; bit `SIM_SW_REST` indicates
that attach is being called by the `RESTORE` command rather than the
`ATTACH` command.

- `t_stat detach_routine(UNIT *uptr)` – Detach unit `uptr`.

In practice, these routines usually invoke the standard SCP routines,
`attach_unit` and `detach_unit`, respectively. For example, here are
special attach and detach routines to update line printer error state:

```c
t_stat lpt_attach (UNIT *uptr, const char *cptr) {
    t_stat r;

    if ((r = attach_unit (uptr, cptr)) != SCPE_OK)
        return r;

    lpt_error = 0;
    return SCPE_OK;
}

t_stat lpt_detach (UNIT *uptr) {
    lpt_error = 1;
    return detach_unit (uptr);
}
```

If the VM specifies an `ATTACH` or `DETACH` routine, SCP bypasses its
normal tests before calling the VM routine. Thus, a VM `DETACH`
routine cannot be assured that the unit is actually attached and must
test the unit flags if required.

SCP executes a `DETACH ALL` command as part of simulator exit. Normally,
`DETACH ALL` only calls a unit’s detach routine if the unit’s `UNIT_ATT`
flag is set. During simulator exit, the detach routine is also called
if the unit is not flagged as attachable (`UNIT_ATTABLE` is not
set). This allows the detach routine of a non-attachable unit to
function as a simulator-specific cleanup routine for the unit, device,
or entire simulator.

### Memory Size Change Routine

Most units instantiate any memory array at the maximum size
possible. This allows apparent memory size to be changed by varying
the `capac` field in the unit structure. For some devices (like the
VAX CPU), instantiating the maximum memory size would impose a
significant resource burden if less memory was actually needed. These
devices must provide a routine, the memory size change routine, for
RESTORE to use if memory size must be changed:

- `t_stat change_mem_size(UNIT *uptr, int32 val, const char *cptr,
  void *desc)` – Change the capacity (memory size) of unit `uptr` to
  `val`. The `cptr` and `desc` arguments are included for
  compatibility with the `SET` command’s validation routine calling
  sequence.

### Debug Controls

Devices can support debug printouts. Debug printouts are controlled by
the SET {NO}DEBUG command, which specifies where debug output should
be printed; and by the SET \<device\> {NO}DEBUG command, which enables
or disables individual debug printouts.

If a device supports debug printouts, device flag DEV_DEBUG must be
set. Field `dctrl` is used for the debug control flags. If a device
supports only a single debug on/off flag, then the `debflags` field
should be set to `NULL`. If a device supports multiple debug on/off
flags, then the correspondence between bit positions in `dctrl` and
debug flag names is specified by table `debflags`. `debflags` points
to a contiguous array of `DEBTAB` structures (typedef `DEBTAB`). Each
DEBTAB structure specifies a single debug flag:

```c
struct DEBTAB {
    const char name; /* flag name */
    uint32 mask; /* control bit */
    const char *desc; /* description */
};
```

The fields are the following:

|        |                                |
|--------|--------------------------------|
| `name` | name of the debug flag.        |
| `mask` | bit mask of the debug flag.    |
| `desc` | description of the debug flag. |

The array is terminated with a `NULL` entry.

The use and definition of debug mask values is up to the particular
simulator device. Some simulator support libraries define their own
debug mask values that can be used to display various details about
the internal activities of the respective library. Libraries defined
debug masks a defined starting at the high bits in 32 bit the mask
word, so device specific masks should start their mask definitions
with the low bits to avoid unexpected debug output if the definitions
collide.

Simulator code can produce debug output by calling sim_debug which is
declared (in header file `scp.h`):

`void sim_debug(uint32 dbits, DEVICE *dptr, const char *fmt, ...)`

The dbits is a flag which matches a mask in a sim_debtab structure,
and the the dptr is the `DEVICE` which has the corresponding dctl
field.

Additionally support exists for displaying bit and bitfield
values. Bit field values are defined using the `BITFIELD` structure and
the `BIT` macros to declare the bits and bitfields.

|                          |                                            |
|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `BIT(nm)`                | Single Bit definition                      |
| `BITNC`                  | Don't care Bit definition                  |
| `BITF(nm, sz)`           | Bit Field definition                       |
| `BITNCF(sz)`             | Don't care Bit Field definition            |
| `BITF_*(nm, sz)`         | Bit Field definition with chosen display   |
| `BITFNAM(nm, sz, names)` | Bit Field definition with value-\>name map |
| `ENDBITS`                |                                            |

For example:

```c
static const char *rp_fname[CS1_N_FNC] = {
    "NOP", "UNLD", "SEEK", "RECAL", "DCLR", "RLS",
    "OFFS", "RETN","PRESET", "PACK", "SEARCH",
    "WRCHK", "WRITE", "WRHDR", "READ", "RDHDR"
};

BITFIELD xx_csr_bits[] = {
    BIT(GO),                  /* Go */
    BITFNAM(FUNC,5,rp_fname), /* Function Code */
    BIT(IE),                  /* Interrupt Enable */
    BIT(RDY),                 /* Drive Ready */
    BIT(DVA),                 /* Drive Available */
    BITNCF(1),                /* 12 Reserved */
    BIT(TRE),                 /* Transfer Error */
    BIT(SC),                  /* Special Condition */
    ENDBITS
};
```

The fields in a register can be displayed (along with transition
indicators) by calling `sim_debug_bits_hdr` or `sim_debug_bits`.

```c
void sim_debug_bits_hdr(uint32 dbits, DEVICE *dptr,
                        const char *header, BITFIELD *bitdefs,
                        uint32 before, uint32 after, int terminate);

void sim_debug_bits(uint32 dbits, DEVICE *dptr, BITFIELD *bitdefs,
                    uint32 before, uint32 after, int terminate);
```

### Device Specific Help support

A device declaration may specify a device type or class in the flags
field by providing one of `DEV_DISK`, `DEV_TAPE`, `DEV_MUX`,
`DEV_ETHER` or `DEV_DISPLAY` values when initializing the flags. The
device type allows the SCP `HELP` command routine to provide some
default help information for devices which don’t otherwise specify a
device specific help routine or a attach_help routine.

### Help Routine

A device declaration may provide a routine which will display help
about that device when a user enters a “HELP dev” command.

- `t_stat help(FILE *st, DEVICE *dptr, UNIT *uptr, int32 flag, const
  char *cptr)` – Write help information about the device and/or unit
  usage. The flag and `cptr` arguments are included for compatibility
  with the HELP command’s validation routine calling sequence.

### Attach Help Routine

A device declaration may provide a routine which will display help
about the attach command for this device.

- `t_stat attach_help(FILE *st, DEVICE *dptr, UNIT *uptr, int32 flag,
  const char *cptr)` – Write help information about the device and/or
  unit attach usage. The flag and `cptr` arguments are included for
  compatibility with the `HELP` command’s validation routine calling
  sequence.

## UNIT Structure

Units are allocated as contiguous array. Each unit is defined with a `UNIT` structure (`typedef UNIT`):

```c
struct UNIT {
    struct UNIT *next; /* next active */
    t_stat (*action)(); /* action routine */
    char *filename; /* open file name */
    FILE *fileref; /* file reference */
    void *filebuf; /* memory buffer */
    uint32 hwmark; /* high water mark */
    int32 time; /* time out */
    uint32 flags; /* flags */
    uint32 dynflags; /* dynamic flags */
    t_addr capac; /* capacity */
    t_addr pos; /* file position */
    void (*io_flush)(); /* i/o flush routine */
    uint32 iostarttime; /* i/o start time */
    int32 buf; /* buffer */
    int32 wait; /* wait */
    int32 u3; /* device specific */
    int32 u4; /* device specific */
    int32 u5; /* device specific */
    int32 u6; /* device specific */
    void *up7; /* device specific */
    void *up8; /* device specific */
};
```

The simulator accessible fields are the following:

| name          | description                                                 |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------|
| `next`        | pointer to next unit in active queue, `NULL` if none.                          |
| `action`      | address of unit time-out service routine.                                      |
| `filename`    | pointer to name of attached file, `NULL` if none.                              |
| `fileref`     | pointer to FILE structure of attached file, `NULL` if none.                    |
| `hwmark`      | buffered devices only; highest modified address, + 1.                          |
| `time`        | increment until time-out beyond previous unit in active queue.                 |
| `flags`       | unit flags.                                                                    |
| `dynflags`    | dynamic flags.                                                                 |
| `capac`       | unit capacity, 0 if variable.                                                  |
| `pos`         | sequential devices only; next device address to be read or written.            |
| `io_flush`    | I/O flush routine, `NULL` if none.                                             |
| `iostarttime` | simulation time (from `sim_grtime()`) for use with <br> `sim_activate_notbefore()`. |
| `buf`         | by convention, the unit buffer, but can be used for other purposes.            |
| `wait`        | by convention, the unit wait time, but can be used for other purposes.         |
| `u3`          | user-defined.                                                                  |
| `u4`          | user-defined.                                                                  |
| `u5`          | user-defined.                                                                  |
| `u6`          | user-defined.                                                                  |
| `up7`         | user-defined void pointer (useful for a unit specific context).                |
| `up8`         | user-defined void pointer (useful for a unit specific context).                |

`buf`, `wait`, `u3`, `u4`, `u5`, `u6`, and parts of `flags` are all
saved and restored by the `SAVE` and `RESTORE` commands and thus can be
used for unit state which must be preserved. The values of `up7`, `up8`
and any device specific internal pointer variables must be established
in the device reset or attach routines to be properly behaved across
`SAVE`/`RESTORE` activities.

Macro `UDATA` is available to fill in the common fields of a UNIT. It
is invoked by:

```c
UDATA(action_routine, flags, capacity)
```

Fields after `buf` can be filled in manually, e.g,

```c
UNIT lpt_unit =
    { UDATA (&lpt_svc, UNIT_SEQ+UNIT_ATTABLE, 0), 500 };
```

defines the line printer as a sequential unit with a wait time of 500.

### Unit Flags

The `flags` field contains indicators of current unit status. SIMH
defines 13 flags:

| flag name      | meaning if set                                          |
|----------------|---------------------------------------------------------|
| `UNIT_ATTABLE` | the unit responds to ATTACH and DETACH.                 |
| `UNIT_RO`      | the unit is currently read only.                        |
| `UNIT_FIX`     | the unit is fixed capacity.                             |
| `UNIT_SEQ`     | the unit is sequential.                                 |
| `UNIT_ATT`     | the unit is currently attached to a file.               |
| `UNIT_BINK`    | the unit measures “K” as 1024, rather than 1000.        |
| `UNIT_BUFABLE` | the unit buffers its data set in memory.                |
| `UNIT_MUSTBUF` | the unit allocates its data buffer dynamically.         |
| `UNIT_BUF`     | the unit is currently buffering its data set in memory. |
| `UNIT_ROABLE`  | the unit can be ATTACHed read only.                     |
| `UNIT_DISABLE` | the unit responds to ENABLE and DISABLE.                |
| `UNIT_DIS`     | the unit is currently disabled.                         |
| `UNIT_IDLE`    | the unit is idle eligible.                              |

A unit is “active” when it is in the SIMH event queue. Units are made
active by a call to `sim_activate` or a similar routine. A request to
idle SIMH is not performed unless the unit at the head of the event
queue (the unit with the shortest remaining time) has the `UNIT_IDLE`
flag set. In VMs that want to support idling, devices that poll for
data (such as console and mux terminals) and clocks should use a
multiple of the clock period as their poll interval, they should use
clock co-scheduling to properly align their servicing with clock
ticks, and all these units should be marked with `UNIT_IDLE`. Other
devices (like disk) usually have shorter service times, and would not
typically be marked with `UNIT_IDLE`.

Units for sequential devices (`UNIT_SEQ`) must update the unit
structure `pos` member to reflect the position in the attached
sequential device file as data is read or written to that file. The
`pos` value is used to position the attached file whenever simulation
execution starts or resumes from the `sim>` prompt.

Starting at bit position `UNIT_V_UF` up to but not including `UNIT_V_RSV`,
the remaining flags are unit-specific. Unit-specific flags are set and
cleared with the `SET` and `CLEAR` commands, which reference the `MTAB`
array (see below). Unit-specific flags and `UNIT_DIS` are automatically
saved and restored; the device need not supply a register for these
bits.

### Service Routine

This routine is called by `sim_process_event` when a unit times
out. Its calling sequence is:

- `t_stat service_routine(UNIT *uptr)`

The status returned by the service routine is passed by
`sim_process_event` back to the CPU.

If the user has typed the interrupt character (^E), it returns
`SCPE_STOP`.

## REG Structure

Registers are allocated as contiguous array, with a `NULL` register at
the end. Each register is defined with a `REG` structure (`typedef
REG`):

```c
struct REG {
    const char *name;        /* name */
    void *loc;               /* location */
    uint32 radix;            /* radix */
    uint32 width;            /* width */
    uint32 offset;           /* starting bit */
    uint32 depth;            /* save depth */
    const char *desc;        /* description */
    struct bitfield *fields; /* bit fields */
    uint32 flags;            /* flags */
    uint32 qptr;             /* current queue pointer */
    size_t str_size;         /* structure size */
};
```

The fields are the following:

| name       | description                                                   |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name`     | register name, string of all capital alphanumeric characters. |
| `loc`      | pointer to location of the register value.                    |
| `radix`    | radix for input and display of data, 2 to 16 inclusive.       |
| `width`    | width in bits of data, 1 to 64 inclusive.                     |
| `offset`   | bit offset (from right end of data).                          |
| `depth`    | size of data array (normally 1).                              |
| `desc`     | register description.                                         |
| `fields`   | bit fields and formatting information.                        |
| `qptr`     | for a circular queue, the entry number for the first entry    |
| `str_size` | structure size.                                               |
| `flags`    | flags and formatting information.                             |

The `depth` field is used with “arrayed registers”. Arrayed registers
are used to represent structures with multiple data values, such as
the locations in a transfer buffer; or structures which are replicated
in every unit, such as a drive status register. The `qptr` field is
used with “queued registers”. Queued registers are arrays that are
organized as circular queues, such as the PC change queue. The `desc`
field (if present) is displayed by the `HELP dev REGISTER` command to
enumerate the device registers and describe them. The `fields` field
(if present) is used to display details of a register’s content
according to the respective field descriptions.

A register that is 32b or less keeps its data in a 32b scalar variable
(`signed` or `unsigned`). A register that is 33b or more keeps its data in
a 64b scalar variable (`signed` or `unsigned`). There are several
exceptions to this rule:

- An arrayed register keeps its data in a C-array whose SIMH data type
  is as large as (or if necessary, larger than), the width of a
  register element. For example, an array of 6b registers would keep
  its data in a `uint8` (or `int8`) array; an array of 16b registers
  would keep its data in a `uint16` (or `int16`) array; an array of
  24b registers would keep its data in a `uint32` (or `int32`) array.
- A register flagged with `REG_FIT` obeys the sizing rules of an
  arrayed register, rather than a normal scalar register. This is
  useful for aliasing registers into memory or into structures.

Macros `ORDATA`, `DRDATA`, `HRDATA`, and `BINDATA` define
right-justified octal, decimal, hexadecimal, and binary registers,
respectively. They are invoked by:

- `xRDATA(name, location, width)`

Macro `FLDATA` defines a one-bit binary flag at an arbitrary offset in
a 32-bit word. It is invoked by:

- `FLDATA`(name, location, bit_position)`

Macro `GRDATA` defines a register with arbitrary location and
radix. It is invoked by:

- `GRDATA(name, location, radix, width, bit_position)`

Macro `BRDATA` defines an arrayed register whose data is kept in a
standard C array. It is invoked by:

- `BRDATA(name, location, radix, width, depth)`

Macro `VBRDATA` defines an arrayed register whose scalar data elements
are accessed as if they were in a standard C array, but the location
is an arbitrary pointer to memory. It is invoked by:

- `VBRDATA(name, location, radix, width, depth)`

For all of these macros, the `flag` field can be filled in manually, e.g.,

```c
REG lpt_reg = {
    { DRDATA (POS, lpt_unit.pos, 31), PV_LEFT }, … }
```

Macro `URDATA` defines an arrayed register whose data is part of the
`UNIT` structure. This macro must be used with great care. If the
fields are set up wrong, or the data is actually kept somewhere else,
storing through this register declaration can trample over memory. The
macro is invoked by:

- `URDATA(name, location, radix, width, offset, depth, flags)`

The location should be an offset in the `UNIT` structure for
unit 0. The width should be 32 for an `int32` or `uint32` field, and
`T_ADDR_W` for a `t_addr` field. The flags can be any of the normal
register flags; `REG_UNIT` will be OR’d in automatically. For example,
the following declares an arrayed register of all the `UNIT` position
fields in a device with 4 units:

```c
{ URDATA (POS, dev_unit[0].pos, 8, T_ADDR_W, 0, 4, 0) }
```

Finally, macro `STRDATA` defines an arrayed register whose data is
part of an arbitrary structure array. This macro must be used with
great care. If the fields are set up wrong, or the data is actually
kept somewhere else, storing through this register declaration can
trample over memory. The macro is invoked by:

- `STRDATA(name, location, radix, width, offset, depth, size, flags)`

The location should be the address in the structure for the first
element (0) of the structure array. The width should be 32 for an
`int32` or `uint32` field, and `T_ADDR_W` for a `t_addr` field. The
flags can be any of the normal register flags; `REG_STRUCT` will be OR’d
in automatically. For example, the following declares an arrayed
register of all the `UNIT` position fields in a device with 4 units:

```c
{ STRDATA (POS, dev_unit[0].pos, 8, T_ADDR_W, 0, 4, sizeof(dev_unit[0]), 0) }
```

Each of the `ORDATA`, `DRDATA`, `FLDATA`, `GRDATA`, `BRDATA`,
`VBRDATA`, `URDATA`, and `STRDATA` macros have corresponding `D` and
`DF` macros (`ORDATAD`, `DRDATAD`, `FLDATAD`, `GRDATAD`, `BRDATAD`,
`VBRDATAD`, `URDATAD` ,`STRDATAD`, `ORDATADF`, `DRDATADF`, `FLDATADF`,
`GRDATADF`, `BRDATADF`, `VBRDATADF`, `URDATADF` and `STRDATADF`) which
can be used to provide initialization values to the `desc` fields in
the `REG` structure.

Macro `SAVEDATA` defines an object which will be store and restored
from a saved simulator image without any consideration for the format
it contains. `SAVEDATA` REGisters cannot be examined or deposited
to. This macro must be used with great care. The data being saved and
restored is may not be meaningfully correct if the save environment
has a different host architecture than the restoring one. The macro is
invoked by:

- `SAVEDATA(name, location)`

The location can be anywhere, but should name an object (scalar,
array, structure, etc.) that will be saved and restored in its
entirety. For example, the following declares an arrayed register of
all the `UNIT` position fields in a device with 4 units:

```c
{ BLOBDATA (SETUP, xs_dev.setup) }
```

A generic register population macro exists called
`REGDATA`. Simulators using this macro will be protected against
future changes to the `REG` structure. If new fields are added to this
structure a new initialization macro will be provided, but all uses of
the prior macro will continue to work correctly.

All `REG` variables should be initialized with one of the register
initialization macros. Using these macros protects these declarations
from any changes that may occur to the `REG` structure in the future
since if any changes are made to the `REG` structure the macros will
be changed to reflect the necessary changes.

- `REGDATA(name, location, radix, width, offset, depth, desc, fields, flags, qptr, size)`

### Register Flags

The `flags` field contains indicators that control register
examination and deposit.

| flag name     | meaning if specified                                           |
|---------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PV_RZRO`     | print register right justified with leading zeroes.            |
| `PV_RSPC`     | print register right justified with leading spaces.            |
| `PV_RCOMMA`   | print register right justified space fill comma’s every 3.     |
| `PV_LEFT`     | print register left justified.                                 |
| `REG_RO`      | register is read only.                                         |
| `REG_HIDDEN`  | register is hidden (will not appear in `EXAMINE STATE`).       |
| `REG_HRO`     | register is read only and hidden.                              |
| `REG_NZ`      | new register values must be non-zero.                          |
| `REG_UNIT`    | register resides in the `UNIT` structure.                      |
| `REG_STRUCT`  | register resides in an arbitrary structure.                    |
| `REG_CIRC`    | register is a circular queue.                                  |
| `REG_VMIO`    | register is displayed and parsed using VM data routines.       |
| `REG_VMAD`    | register is displayed and parsed using VM address routines.    |
| `REG_FIT`     | register container uses arrayed rather than scalar size rules. |
| `REG_DEPOSIT` | register updates invoke VM register update routine.            |

The `PV` flags are mutually exclusive. `PV_RZRO` is the default if no
formatting flag is specified.

Starting at bit position `REG_V_UF`, the remaining flags are
user-defined. These flags are passed to the VM-defined `fprint_sym`
and `parse_sym` routines in the upper bits of the `addr` parameter;
they are merged with the lower 16 bits containing the register radix
value.

If a user-defined flag or the `REG_VMIO` flag is specified in a
register’s `flag` field, the `EXAMINE` and `DEPOSIT` commands will
call `fprint_sym` and `parse_sym` instead of the standard print and
parse routines. The user-defined flags passed in the `addr` parameter
may be used to identify the register or determine how it is to be
handled.

If the `REG_DEPOSIT` flag is specified in a register’s `flag` field,
register deposits will call VM-defined `reg_update` after the register
contents have been changed. The VM-defined `reg_update` routine may
reference the user-defined flags specified in the register definition
to identify the register or determine any consequences related to
updating that register.

If `REG_UNIT` is clear, the register data is located at the address
specified by the `loc` pointer. If `REG_UNIT` is set, the register
name is used to refer to a field in a `UNIT` structure, and `loc`
points to that field in the `UNIT` struct for unit 0. The examine and
deposit commands will adjust that address by the unit number times the
size of the `UNIT` struct to determine the actual data address.

## `BITFIELD` Structure

Bitfields are allocated as contiguous array, with a `NULL` bitfield at
the end. Each bitfield is defined with a `BITFIELD` structure
(`typedef BITFIELD`):

```c
struct BITFIELD {
    const char *name; /* field name */
    uint32 offset; /* starting bit */
    uint32 width; /* width */
    const char **valuenames; /* map of values to strings */
    BITF_FMT format; /* value display style */
};
```

The fields are the following:

| name       | description                                                   |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `name` | field name, string of alphanumeric characters. |
| `offset` | starting bit (normally populated automatically). |
| `width` | width in bits of data, 1 to 32 inclusive. |
| `valuenames` | pointer to a string array which maps field values |
| `format` | value display style selected by the `BITF_*` macros |

Macros `BIT` and `BITF` define single bit and multi-bit fields,
respectively. They are invoked by:

- `BIT(name)`
- `BITF(name, width)`

Macros `BITNC` and `BITNCF` define single bit and multi-bit don’t care
fields, respectively. They are invoked by:

- `BITNC`
- `BITNCF(width)`

The `BITF_*` macros define bit fields with specific display styles.
Prefer these named helpers instead of raw printf format strings.
They are invoked by:

- `BITF_SIGNED(name, width)`
- `BITF_UNSIGNED(name, width)`
- `BITF_HEX2(name, width)`
- `BITF_HEX2P(name, width)`
- `BITF_HEX4P(name, width)`
- `BITF_QHEX2(name, width)`
- `BITF_QOCTAL(name, width)`
- `BITF_QUNSIGNED(name, width)`
- `BITF_QHEXP(name, width)`

The helpers display values as follows:

| helper | example output |
|--------|----------------|
| `BITF_SIGNED` | `NAME=-1` |
| `BITF_UNSIGNED` | `NAME=255` |
| `BITF_HEX2` | `NAME=FF` |
| `BITF_HEX2P` | `NAME=0xFF` |
| `BITF_HEX4P` | `NAME=0x00FF` |
| `BITF_QHEX2` | `NAME="FF"` |
| `BITF_QOCTAL` | `NAME="377"` |
| `BITF_QUNSIGNED` | `NAME="255"` |
| `BITF_QHEXP` | `NAME="0xFF"` |

Macro `BITFNAM` defines a bit field with a value to name string
map. It is invoked by:

- `BITFNAM(name, width, maparray)`

Macro `STARTBIT` resets fields to the beginning of the register. This
is useful when other conditions redefine the structure of a register’s
contents. It is invoked by:

- `STARTBIT`

## `MTAB` Structure

Device-specific `SHOW` and `SET` commands are processed using the
modifications array, which is allocated as contiguous array, with a
`NULL` at the end. Each possible modification is defined with a `MTAB`
structure (`typedef MTAB`), which has the following fields:

```c
struct MTAB {
    uint32 mask; /* mask */
    uint32 match; /* match */
    const char *pstring; /* print string */
    const char *mstring; /* match string */
    t_stat (*valid)(); /* validation routine */
    t_stat (*disp)(); /* display routine */
    void *desc; /* location descriptor */
    const char *help; /* help string */
};
```

`MTAB` supports two different structure interpretations: regular and
extended. A regular `MTAB` entry modifies flags in the `UNIT` flags
word; the descriptor entry is not used. The fields are the following:

| name       | description                                                   |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mask` | bit mask for testing the `unit.flags` field |
| `match` | value to be stored (`SET`) or compared (`SHOW`) |
| `pstring` | pointer to character string printed on a match (`SHOW`), or `NULL` |
| `mstring` | pointer to character string to be matched (`SET`), or `NULL` |
| `valid` | address of validation routine (`SET`), or `NULL` |
| `disp` | address of display routine (`SHOW`), or `NULL` |

For `SET`, a regular `MTAB` entry is interpreted as follows:

1.  Test to see if the `mstring` entry exists.
2.  Test to see if the `SET` parameter matches the `mstring`.
3.  Call the validation routine, if any.
4.  Apply the `mask` value to the `UNIT` flags word and then or in the
    `match` value.

For `SHOW`, a regular `MTAB` entry is interpreted as follows:

1.  Test to see if the `mstring` entry exists.
2.  Test to see if the `UNIT` flags word, masked with the `mask`
    value, equals the `match` value.
3.  If a display routine exists, call it, otherwise
4.  Print the `pstring`.

Extended `MTAB` entries have a different interpretation:

| name       | description                                                   |
|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| `mask` | entry flags<br>`MTAB_XTD` extended entry<br>`MTAB_VDV` valid for devices<br>`MTAB_VUN` valid for units<br>`MTAB_VALR` requires a value<br>`MTAB_VALO` optionally accepts a value<br>`MTAB_NMO` valid only in named `SHOW`<br>`MTAB_NC` do not convert option value to upper case<br>`MTAB_SHP` `SHOW` parameter takes optional value<br> |
| `match` | value to be stored (`SET`) |
| `pstring` | pointer to character string printed on a match (`SHOW`), or `NULL` |
| `mstring` | pointer to character string to be matched (`SET`), or `NULL` |
| `valid` | address of validation routine (`SET`), or `NULL` |
| `disp` | address of display routine (`SHOW`), or `NULL` |
| `desc` | pointer to data address (**valid** clear) or<br>a validation-specific structure (**valid** set) |

For `SET`, an extended `MTAB` entry is interpreted as follows:

1.  Test to see if the `mstring` entry exists.
2.  Test to see if the `SET` parameter matches the `mstring`.
3.  Test to see if the entry is valid for the type of `SET` being done
    (`SET` device or `SET` unit).
4.  If a validation routine exists, call it and return its status. The
    validation routine is responsible for storing the result.
5.  If `desc` is `NULL`, exit.
6.  Otherwise, store the `match` value in the int32 pointed to by `desc`.

For `SHOW`, an extended `MTAB` entry is interpreted as follows:

1.  Test to see if the `mstring` entry exists.
2.  Test to see if the entry is valid for the type of `SHOW` being
    done (device or unit).
3.  If a display routine exists, call it, otherwise,
4.  Print the `pstring`.

`SHOW [dev\|unit] \<modifier\>{=\<value\>}` is a special case. Only
two kinds of modifiers can be displayed individually: an extended
`MTAB` entry that takes a value; and any `MTAB` entry with both a
display routine and a `pstring`. Recall that if a display routine
exists, `SHOW` does not use the `pstring` entry. For displaying a
named modifier, `pstring` is used as the string match. This allows
implementation of complex display routines that are only invoked by
name, e.g.,

```c
MTAB cpu_tab[] = {
    { mask, value, "normal", "NORMAL", NULL, NULL, NULL },
    { MTAB_XTD|MTAB_VDV|MTAB_NMO, 0, "SPECIAL",
        NULL, NULL, NULL, &spec_disp },
    { 0 }
};
```

A `SHOW CPU` command will display only the modifier named `NORMAL`;
but `SHOW CPU SPECIAL` will invoke the special display routine.

### Validation Routine

The validation routine can be used to validate input during `SET`
processing. It can make other state changes required by the
modification or initiate additional dialogs needed by the
modifier. Its calling sequence is:

- `t_stat validation_routine(UNIT *uptr, int32 value, const char
  *cptr, void *desc)` – test that `uptr`.`flags` can be set to
  `value`. `cptr` points to the value portion of the parameter string
  (any characters after the = sign); if `cptr` is `NULL`, no value was
  given. `desc` points to the `REG` or int32 used to store the
  parameter.

### Display Routine

The display routine is called during `SHOW` processing to display
device- or unit-specific state. Its calling sequence is:

- `t_stat display_routine(FILE *st, UNIT *uptr, int32 value, const
  void *desc)` – output device- or unit-specific state for `uptr` to
  stream `st`. If the modifier is regular `MTAB` entry, or an extended
  entry without `MTAB_SHP` set, `desc` points to the structure in the
  `MTAB` entry. If the modifier is an extended `MTAB` entry with
  `MTAB_SHP` set, `desc` points to the optional value string or is
  `NULL` if no value was supplied. `value` is the value field of the
  matched `MTAB` entry.

When the display routine is called, `SHOW` hasn’t output
anything. `SHOW` will append a newline after the display routine
returns, except for extended entries with the `MTAB_NMO` flag set.

### Help Flags

The flags `MTAB_VALR` and `MTAB_VALO` are used to construct command
syntax examples when displaying help for `SET` and `SHOW`
commands. These flags do not otherwise influence the actions taken
during processing of `SET` or `SHOW` commands.

### Example arguments in the `mstring`

The value of the `mstring` field may contain examples of valid
additional parameters which may be specified as values. For example:

```c
MTAB cr_mod[] = {
    { mask, value, "normal", "NORMAL", NULL, NULL, NULL },
    { MTAB_XTD|MTAB_VDV, 0, "TRANSLATION",
      "TRANSLATION={DEFAULT|026|026FTN|029|EBCDIC}",
      NULL, &cr_set_trans, &cr_show_trans },
    { 0 }
};
```

This entry has an `mstring` value of
“TRANSLATION={DEFAULT\|026\|026FTN\|029\|EBCDIC}”. When comparisons
are made against this string, everything starting at the equal sign
and beyond is irrelevant to the match activity since the input being
compared has already been parsed with a delimiter of `=`. The
remaining parts of the `mstring` value are ignored, but are available
when constructing `HELP` dev `SET` output.

### Help field

The `MTAB` entry’s help field is used when constructing HELP dev SHOW
or HELP dev SHOW output. It serves to describe the purpose or effect
of the particular SET dev or SHOW dev command. The help field is
ignored when constructing HELP dev SET output for `MTAB` entries which
have an equal sign in the mstring field.

## Other Data Structures

`char sim_name[]` is a character array containing the VM name.

`int32 sim_emax` contains the maximum number of words needed to hold
the largest instruction or data item in the VM. Examine and deposit
will process up to `sim_emax` words.

`DEVICE *sim_devices[]` is an array of pointers to all the devices in
the VM. It is terminated by a `NULL`. By convention, the CPU is always
the first device in the array.

`REG *sim_PC` points to the `REG` structure for the program
counter. By convention, the PC is always the first register in the
CPU’s register array.

`char *sim_stop_messages[SCPE_BASE]` is an array of pointers to
character strings, corresponding to error status returns greater than
zero. If `sim_instr` returns status code n \> 0 but less than
`SCPE_BASE`, then `sim_stop_message[n]` is printed by SCP. This array
must have valid character pointers for all values `< SCPE_BASE` which
`sim_instr` returns. Declaring the array with dimension `SCPE_BASE` will
properly allow the array to be filled in as needed with appropriate
message text for any messages that are needed while also providing
`NULL` pointers for the remaining possibilities.

# VM Provided Routines

## Instruction Execution

Instruction execution is performed by routine `sim_instr`. Its calling
sequence is:

- `t_stat sim_instr(void)` – execute from current PC until error or halt.

## Binary Load and Dump

If the VM responds to the `LOAD` (or `DUMP`) command, the load routine
(dump routine) is implemented by routine `sim_load`. Its calling
sequence is:

- `t_stat sim_load(FILE *fptr, const char *buf, const char *fnam,
  t_bool flag)` - If `flag = 0`, load data from binary file `fptr`. If
  `flag = 1`, dump data to binary file `fptr`. For either command,
  `buf` contains any VM-specific arguments, and `fnam` contains the
  file name.

If `LOAD` or `DUMP` is not implemented, `sim_load` should simply
return `SCPE_ARG`. The `LOAD` and `DUMP` commands open the specified
file before calling `sim_load`, and close it on return.

`sim_load` may optionally load or dump data in different formats based
on flag options specified in the `sim_switches` variable. If or how
this is done or what any switches mean are completely up to the
simulator’s implementation in the `sim_load` function.

## Symbolic Examination and Deposit

If the VM provides symbolic examination and deposit of data, it must
provide two routines, `fprint_sym` for output and `parse_sym` for
input. Their calling sequences are:

- `t_stat fprint_sym(FILE *ofile, t_addr addr, t_value *val, UNIT
  *uptr, int32 switch)` – Based on the `switch` variable, symbolically
  output to stream `ofile` the data in array `val` at the specified
  `addr` in unit `uptr`.

- `t_stat parse_sym(const char *cptr, t_addr addr, UNIT *uptr, t_value
  *val, int32 switch)` – Based on the `switch` variable, parse
  character string `cptr` for a symbolic value `val` at the specified
  `addr` in unit `uptr`.

If symbolic processing is not implemented, or the output value or
input string cannot be parsed, these routines should return
`SCPE_ARG`. If the processing was successful and consumed more than a
single word, then these routines should return extra number of
addressing units consumed as a `negative` number. If the processing
was successful and consumed a single addressing unit, then these
routines should return `SCPE_OK`. For example, PDP-11 `parse_sym`
would respond as follows to various inputs:

| input           | return value |
|-----------------|--------------|
| `XYZGH`         | `SCPE_ARG`   |
| `MOV R0,R1`     | `-1`         |
| `MOV #4,R5`     | `-3`         |
| `MOV 1234,5670` | `-5`         |

There is an implicit relationship between the `addr` and `val`
arguments and the device’s `aincr` fields. Each entry in `val` is
assumed to represent `aincr` addressing units, starting at `addr`:

|          |                      |
|----------|----------------------|
| `val[0]` | `addr + 0`           |
| `val[1]` | `addr + aincr`       |
| `val[2]` | `addr + (2 * aincr)` |
| `val[3]` | `addr + (3 * aincr)` |

Because `val` is typically filled in and stored by calls on the
device’s examine and deposit routines, respectively, the examine and
deposit routines and `fprint_sym` and `fparse_sym` must agree on the
expected width of items in `val`, and on the alignment of
`addr`. Further, if `fparse_sym` wants to modify a storage unit
narrower than `awidth`, it must insert the new data into the
appropriate entry in `val` without destroying surrounding fields. The
number of words in the `val` array is given by global variable
`sim_emax`.

The interpretation of switch values is arbitrary (except in the cases
noted below), but the following are provided by existing VMs in their
`fprint_sym` implementations:

| switch | interpretation       |
|--------|----------------------|
| `-a`   | single character     |
| `-c`   | character string     |
| `-m`   | instruction mnemonic |

In addition, on input, a leading `'` (apostrophe) is interpreted to
mean a single character, and a leading `"` (double quote) is
interpreted to mean a character string.

`fprint_sym` is called to print the instruction at the program counter
value for the simulation stop message, for registers containing
user-defined or `REG_VMIO` flags in their `flag` fields and memory
values printed by the `EXAMINE` command, and for printing the values
printed by the `EVAL` command. These cases are differentiated by the
presence of special flags in the `switch` parameter. For a simulation
stop, the “M” switch and the `SIM_SW_STOP` switch are passed. For
examining registers, the `SIM_SW_REG` switch is passed. In addition,
the user-defined flags and register radix are passed in the `addr`
parameter. Register radix is taken from the radix specified in the
register definition, or overridden by `-d`, `-o`, or `-x` switches in
the command. For examining memory and the `EVAL` command, no special
switch flags are passed.

`parse_sym` is called to parse memory, register, and the logical and
relational search specifier values for the `DEPOSIT` command and the
symbolic expression for the `EVAL` command. As with `fprint_sym`, these
cases are differentiated by the presence of special flags in the
`switch` parameter. For registers, the `SIM_SW_REG` switch is
passed. For all other cases, no special switch flags are passed.

## Optional Interfaces

For greater flexibility, SCP provides some optional interfaces that
can be used to extend its command input, command processing, and
command post-processing capabilities. These interfaces are strictly
optional and are off by default. Using them requires intimate
knowledge of how SCP functions internally and is not recommended to
the novice VM writer.

### Once Only Initialization Routine

SCP previously defined a pointer `(*sim_vm_init)(void)`. This was a
“weak global”; the intention of this routine was that if no other
module defines this value, it will default to `NULL`. A VM requiring
special initialization would fill in this pointer with the address of
its special initialization routine:

```c
WEAK void sim_special_init (void);
WEAK void (*sim_vm_init)(void) = &sim_special_init;
```

The special initialization routine could perform any actions required
by the VM. If the other optional interfaces are to be used, the
initialization routine could also fill in the appropriate pointers.

Due to the lack of reliable functionality across all different supported
host platforms, this “weak global” paradigm has been removed. These
activities must now be done in the CPU reset routine (since that is
called during SCP initialization, as well as when a `RESET` command is
issued later on). When these are done in the CPU reset routine, care
should be taken to only perform them once if they have any side
effects (like clearing all memory).

### Address Input and Display

SCP defines a pointer:

`t_addr *(sim_vm_parse_addr)(DEVICE *, const char *, const char **)`

This is initialized to `NULL`. If it is filled in by the VM, SCP will
use the specified routine to parse addresses in place of its standard
numerical input routine. The current command switches, if needed, may
be read from the global variable `sim_switches`. The calling sequence
for the `sim_vm_parse_addr` routine is:

- `t_addr sim_vm_parse_addr(DEVICE *dptr, const char *cptr, const char
  **optr)` – parse the string pointed to by `cptr` as an address for
  the device pointed to by `dptr`. `optr` points to the first
  character not successfully parsed. If `cptr == optr`, parsing
  failed.

SCP defines a pointer:

`void *(sim_vm_fprint_addr)(FILE *, DEVICE *, t_addr)`

 This is initialized to `NULL`. If it is filled in by the VM, SCP will
 use the specified routine to print addresses in place of its standard
 numerical output routine. The calling sequence for the
 `sim_vm_fprint_addr` routine is:

- `t_addr sim_vm_fprint_addr(FILE *stream, DEVICE *dptr, t_addr addr)`
  – output address `addr` to `stream` in the format required by the
  device pointed to by `dptr`.

SCP defines a pointer:

`void *(sim_vm_sprint_addr)(FILE *, DEVICE *, t_addr)`

This is initialized to `NULL`. If it is filled in by the VM, SCP will
use the specified routine to print addresses in place of its standard
numerical output routine. The calling sequence for the
`sim_vm_sprint_addr` routine is:

- `t_addr sim_vm_sprint_addr(char *buf, DEVICE *dptr, t_addr addr)` –
  output address `addr` to `buf` in the format required by the device
  pointed to by `dptr`.

### Command Input and Post-Processing

SCP defines a pointer:

`char *(sim_vm_read)(char *, int32 *, FILE *)`

This is initialized to `NULL`. If it is filled in by the VM, SCP will
use the specified routine to obtain command input in place of its
standard routine, read_line. The calling sequence for the
`sim_vm_read` routine is:

- `char sim_vm_input(char *buf, int32 *max, FILE *stream)` – read the
  next command line from `stream` and store it in `buf`, up to a
  maximum of `max` characters

The routine is expected to strip off leading whitespace characters and
to return `NULL` on end of file.

SCP defines a pointer:

`void *(sim_vm_post)(t_bool from_scp)`

This is initialized to `NULL`. If filled in by the VM, SCP will call
the specified routine at the end of every command. This allows the VM
to update any local state, such as a GUI console display. The calling
sequence for the vm_post routine is:

- `void sim_vm_postupdate(t_bool from_scp)` – if called from SCP, the
  argument `from_scp` is `TRUE`; otherwise, it is `FALSE`.

### Simulator Stop Message Formatting

SCP defines a pointer, `sim_vm_fprint_stopped`, to a function taking
parameters of type `FILE *` and `t_stat` and returning a value of type
`t_bool`. It is initialized to `NULL` but may be reset by the VM to
point at a routine that will be called when a simulator stop
occurs. The calling sequence is:

- `t_bool vm_fprint_stopped(FILE *stream, t_stat reason)` – write a
  simulator stop message to `stream` for the `reason` specified, and
  return `TRUE` if SCP should append the program counter value or
  `FALSE` if SCP should not

When the instruction loop is exited, SCP regains control and prints a simulator stop message. By default, the message is printed with this format:

> \<reason\>, \<program counter label\>: \<address\> (\<instruction mnemonic\>)

For example:

- `SCPE_STOP` prints `"Simulation stopped, P: 24713 (LOAD 1)"`
- `SCPE_STEP` prints `"Step expired, P: 24713 (LOAD 1)"`

For VM stops, this routine is called after the reason has been printed
and before the comma, program counter label, address, and instruction
mnemonic are printed. Depending on the reason for the stop, the
routine may insert additional information, and it may request omission
of the PC value by returning `FALSE` instead of `TRUE`. For example, a
VM may define these stops and their associated formats:

- `STOP_SYSHALT` prints `"System halt 3, P: 24713 (LOAD 1)"`
- `STOP_HALT` prints `"Programmed halt, CIR: 030365 (HALT 5), P: 24713 (LOAD 1)"`
- `STOP_CDUMP` prints `"Cold dump complete, CIR: 000020"`

For these examples, the VM’s `vm_fprint_stopped` routine prints `" 3"`
and returns `TRUE` for `STOP_SYSHALT`, prints `", CIR: 030365 (HALT 5)"`
and returns `TRUE` for `STOP_HALT`, prints `", CIR: 000020"` and returns
`FALSE` for `STOP_CDUMP`, and prints nothing and returns `TRUE` for all
other VM stops.

### VM-Specific Commands

SCP defines a pointer `CTAB *sim_vm_cmd`. This is initialized to
`NULL`.

If filled in by the VM, SCP interprets it as a pointer to SCP command
table. This command table is checked before user input is looked up in
the standard command table. It may be used to override or otherwise
arbitrarily extend the functionality of a normal SCP command.

A command table is allocated as a contiguous array. Each entry is
defined with a `sim_ctab` structure (`typedef CTAB`):

```c
struct sim_ctab {
    const char   *name;         /* name */
    t_stat       (*action)();   /* action routine */
    int32        arg;           /* argument */
    const char   *help;         /* help string */
};
```

If the first word of a command line matches `ctab.name`, then the
action routine is called with the following arguments:

- `t_stat action_routine(int32 arg, const char *buf)` – process input
  string `buf` based on optional argument `arg`

The string passed to the action routine starts at the first non-blank
character past the command name.

When looking for a matching command, SCP scans the command table from
first to last entry, looking for a command name that begins with the
command supplied by the user. The first one found is considered the
matching command. If no match is found, the SCP standard command table
is scanned next, using the same “first match” rule. You may need to
adjust command names for VM-specific commands to avoid conflicting
with commonly used standard commands. For example, if a VM defined the
single VM-specific command `NORMAL_START`, SCP would accept “N” as an
abbreviation for this command. This might confuse users who expect “N”
to be an abbreviation of the “NEXT” command. The “first match is used”
rule is useful when a VM needs to redefine a standard SCP command with
a different syntax. For example, the VAX simulators do this in several
different ways to redefine the `BOOT` command.

### VM-Support for stepping over subroutine calls

SCP can provide the ability to step over subroutine calls with the
`NEXT` command. In order for the `NEXT` command to work, the simulator
must provide a VM specific routine which will identify whether the
next instruction to be executed is a subroutine call and, if so to
identify where to dynamically insert breakpoint(s) to stop instruction
execution when the subroutine returns.

SCP defines a pointer:

`t_bool *(sim_vm_is_subroutine_call)(t_addr **ret_addrs)`

This is initialized to `NULL`.

If filled in by the VM, SCP will call the specified routine to
determine where to dynamically place breakpoints to support the `NEXT`
command. The function return value is `TRUE` if the next instruction
is a subroutine call, and argument `ret_addrs` is used to return the
address of a zero-terminated array of addresses where breakpoints are
to be set (i.e., the possible return addresses for the subroutine
being called). The function return value is `FALSE` and `ret_addrs` is
unused if the next instruction is not a subroutine call.

### Displaying the simulator PC value in debug output

Some simulators expose the PC as a register, some don’t expose it or
expose a register which is not a variable that is updated during
instruction execution (i.e. only upon exit of `sim_instr()`). For the
`-P` debug option to be effective, such a simulator should provide a
routine which returns the value of the current PC and set the
`sim_vm_pc_value` routine pointer to that routine.

SCP defines a pointer `t_value *(sim_vm_pc_value)(void)`. This is
initialized to `NULL`. If filled in by the VM, SCP will call the
specified routine to determine active PC value when generating debug
output containing the execution PC (if debug is enabled with the `-P`
flag).

# Other SCP Facilities

## Terminal Input/Output Formatting Library

SIMH provides routines to convert ASCII input characters to the format
expected VM, and to convert VM-supplied ASCII characters to C-standard
format. The routines are:

- `int32 sim_tt_inpcvt(int32 c, uint32 mode)` – convert input
  character `c` according to the `mode` specification and return the
  converted result (-1 if the character is not valid in the specified
  mode).

- `int32 sim_tt_outcvt(int32 c, uint32 mode)` – convert output
  character `c` according to the `mode` specification and return the
  converted result (-1 if the character is not valid in the specified
  mode).

The supported modes are:

| name | interpretation       |
|------|----------------------|
| `TTUF_MODE_8B` | 8b mode; no conversion |
| `TTUF_MODE_7B` | 7b mode; the high-order bit is masked off |
| `TTUF_MODE_7P` | 7b printable mode; the high-order bit is masked off.<br>In addition, on output, if the character is not printable,<br> `-1` is returned. |
| `TTUF_MODE_UC` | 7b upper case mode; the high-order bit is masked off.<br>In addition, lower case is converted to upper case.<br>If the character is not printable, -1 is returned. |

On input, `TTUF_MODE_UC` has an additional modifier, `TTUF_MODE_KSR`,
which forces the high order bit to be set rather than cleared.

The set of printable control characters is contained in the global
bit-vector variable `sim_tt_pchar`. Each bit represents the character
corresponding to the bit number (e.g., bit 0 represents `NUL`, bit 1
represents `SOH`, etc.). If a bit is set, the corresponding control
character is considered printable. It initially contains the following
characters: `BEL`, `BS`, `HT`, `LF`, and `CR`. The set may be
manipulated with these routines:

- `t_stat sim_set_pchar(int32 flag, const char *cptr)` – set
  `sim_tt_pchar` to the value pointed to by `cptr`; return
  `SCPE_2FARG` if `cptr` is null or points to a null string, or
  `SCPE_ARG` if the value cannot be converted or does not contain at
  least `CR` and `LF`. The string argument must be in the default
  radix of the current simulator.

- `t_stat sim_show_pchar(FILE *st, DEVICE *dptr, UNIT *uptr, int32
  flag, const char *cptr)` – output the `sim_tt_pchar` value to the
  stream `st`. The `sim_tt_pchar` value will be displayed in the default
  radix of the current simulator and character mnemonics for each set
  bit will also be displayed.

Note that the `DEL` character is always considered non-printable and
will be suppressed in the UC and 7P modes.

A simulator which will always want a specific set of printable
characters defined should explicitly call `sim_set_pchar` the first
time the simulator’s `cpu_reset` routine is called.

## Terminal Multiplexer Emulation Library

SIMH supports the use of multiple terminals. All terminals except the
console are accessed via Telnet or serial ports on the host
machine.

SIMH provides three supporting libraries for implementing multiple
terminals: `sim_tmxr.c` (and its header file, `sim_tmxr.h`), which
provide OS-independent support routines for terminal multiplexers;
`sim_serial.c` (and its header file `sim_serial.h`), which provide
OS-dependent serial I/O routines; and `sim_sock.c` (and its header
file, `sim_sock.h`), which provide OS-dependent socket
routines. `sim_sock.c` and `sim_serial.c` are implemented under
Windows, VMS, UNIX, and MacOS.

Two basic data structures define the multiple terminals. Individual
lines are defined by an array of `tmln` structures (`typedef TMLN`):

```c
struct tmln {
    int conn; /* line connected flag */
    SOCKET sock; /* connection socket */
    char *ipad; /* IP address */
    SOCKET master; /* line specific master socket */
    char *port; /* line specific listening port */
    int32 sessions; /* count of tcp connections received */
    uint32 cnms; /* connect time ms */
    int32 tsta; /* Telnet state */
    int32 rcve; /* rcv enable */
    int32 xmte; /* xmt enable */
    int32 dstb; /* disable Tlnt bin */
    int32 notelnet; /* raw binary data (no telnet interpret) */
    int32 rxbpr; /* rcv buf remove */
    int32 rxbpi; /* rcv buf insert */
    int32 rxcnt; /* rcv count */
    int32 txbpr; /* xmt buf remove */
    int32 txbpi; /* xmt buf insert */
    int32 txcnt; /* xmt count */
    int32 txdrp; /* xmt drop count */
    int32 txbsz; /* xmt buffer size */
    int32 txbfd; /* xmt buffered flag */
    t_bool modem_control; /* line modem control support */
    t_bool port_speed_control; /* line programmatically sets port speed */
    int32 modembits; /* modem bits which are set */
    FILE *txlog; /* xmt log file */
    FILEREF *txlogref; /* xmt log file reference */
    char *txlogname; /* xmt log file name */
    char rxb[TMXR_MAXBUF]; /* rcv buffer */
    char rbr[TMXR_MAXBUF]; /* rcv break */
    char *txb; /* xmt buffer */
    TMXR *mp; /* back pointer to mux */
    char *serconfig; /* line config */
    SERHANDLE serport; /* serial port handle */
    t_bool ser_connect_pending; /* serial connection notice pending */
    SOCKET connecting; /* Outgoing socket while connecting */
    char *destination; /* Outgoing destination address:port */
    UNIT *uptr; /* input polling unit -default to mp-\>uptr */
    UNIT *o_uptr; /* output polling unit -default to lp-\>uptr */
};
```

The fields are the following:

| name        | description                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `conn`      | connection flag (0 = disconnected)                 |
| `sock`      | connection socket                                  |
| `ipad`      | IP address of remote end of connection             |

| `tsta`      | Telnet state                                       |
| `rcve`      | receive enable flag (0 = disabled)                 |
| `xmte`      | transmit flow control flag (0 = transmit disabled) |
| `dstb`      | Telnet bin mode disabled                           |
| `rxbpr`     | receive buffer remove pointer                      |
| `rxbpi`     | receive buffer insert pointer                      |
| `rxcnt`     | receive count                                      |
| `txbpr`     | transmit buffer remove pointer                     |
| `txbpi`     | transmit buffer insert pointer                     |
| `txcnt`     | transmit count                                     |
| `txlog`     | pointer to log file descriptor                     |
| `txlogname` | pointer to log file name                           |
| `rxb`       | receive buffer                                     |
| `rbr`       | receive buffer break flags                         |
| `txb`       | transmit buffer                                    |

The overall set of extra terminals is defined by the `tmxr` structure
(`typedef TMXR`):

```c
struct tmxr {
    int32 lines; /* \# lines */
    char *port; /* listening port */
    SOCKET master; /* master socket */
    TMLN *ldsc; /* pointer to line descriptors */
    int32 *lnorder; /* line connection order */
    DEVICE *dptr; /* multiplexer device */
    UNIT *uptr; /* polling unit (connection) */
    char logfiletmpl[FILENAMEMAX]; /* template logfile name */
    int23 buffered; /* Buffered line behavior and buffer size*/
    int32 sessions; /* count of tcp connections received */
    uint32 last_poll_time; /* time of last connection poll */
    t_bool notelnet; /* default telnet capability for incoming connections */
    t_bool modem_control; /* multiplexer supports modem control behaviors */
    t_bool port_speed_control; /* multiplexer programmatically sets port speed */
};
```

The fields are the following:

| name        | description                                        |
|-------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| `lines` | number of lines (constant) |
| `port` | master listening port (specified by ATTACH command) |
| `master` | master listening socket (filled in by ATTACH command) |
| `ldsc` | array of line descriptors |
| `lnorder` | array of line numbers in order of connection sequence,<br>or `NULL` if user-defined connection order is not required |
| `dptr` | pointer to the multiplexer’s DEVICE structure,<br>or `NULL` if the device is to be derived from the UNIT passed to the attach call. |
| `uptr` | the UNIT passed to the attach call. |
| `logfiletmpl` | template logfile name used to create names for per-line log files. |
| `buffered` | Buffered line behaviors enabled flag and the size of the line buffer. |
| `sessions` | count of tcp connections received on the master socket. |
| `last_poll_time` | time of last connection poll. |
| `notelnet` | default telnet capability for tcp connections. |
| `modem_control` | flag indicating that multiplexer supports full modem control behaviors. |

The number of elements in the `ldsc` and `lnorder` arrays must equal
the value of the `lines` field. Set `lnorder` to `NULL` if the
connection order feature is not needed. If the first element of the
`lnorder` array is -1, then the default ascending sequential
connection order is used. Set `dptr` to `NULL` if the device should be
derived from the unit passed to the `tmxr_attach` call.

Library `sim_tmxr.c` provides the following routines to support Telnet
and Serial port-based terminals:

- `int32 tmxr_poll_conn(TMXR *mp)` – poll for a new connection to the
  terminals described by `mp`. If there is a new connection, the
  routine resets all the line descriptor state (including receive
  enable) and returns the line number (index to line descriptor) for
  the new connection. If there isn’t a new connection, the routine
  returns -1.

- `void tmxr_reset_ln(TMLN *lp)` – reset the line described by
  `lp`. The connection is closed and all line descriptor state is
  reset.

- `int32 tmxr_getc_ln(TMLN *lp)` – return the next available character
  from the line described by `lp`. If a character is available, the
  return value is: `(1 << TMXR_V_VALID) | character`. If a `BREAK`
  occurred on the line, `SCPE_BREAK` will be ORed into the return
  variable. If no character is available, the return value is 0.

- `void tmxr_poll_rx(TMXR *mp)` – poll for input available on the
  terminals described by `mp`.

- `int32 tmxr_rqln(TMLN *lp)` – return the number of characters in the
  receive queue of the line described by `lp` which are ready to be
  read now.

- `t_stat tmxr_putc_ln(TMLN *lp, int32 chr)` – output character `chr`
  to the line described by `lp`. Possible errors are `SCPE_LOST`
  (connection lost) and `SCPE_STALL` (connection backlogged). If
  executed directly in instruction simulation code (as opposed to
  during event processing) and line output rate limiting is in effect,
  then inter-character delays will occur before this routine returns.

- `void tmxr_poll_tx(TMXR *mp)` – poll for output complete on the
  terminals described by `mp`.

- `int32 tmxr_tqln(TMLN *lp)` – return the number of characters in the
  transmit queue of the line described by `lp`.

- `int32 tmxr_txdone_ln(TMLN *lp)` – return the transmit complete
  indicator for the the line described by `lp`. `0` – not done, `1` –
  just now done, `-1` – previously done. When the `1` return value is
  returned would be a good time to pass an interrupt or other status
  information into the system being simulated.

- `void tmxr_send_buffered_data(TMLN *lp)` – flush any buffered data
  for the line described by `lp`.

- `t_stat tmxr_attach(TMXR *mp, UNIT *uptr, const char *cptr)` –
  attach the port contained in character string `cptr` to the
  terminals described by `mp` and unit `uptr`.

- `t_stat tmxr_open_master(TMXR *mp, const char *cptr)` – associate
  the port contained in character string `cptr` to the terminals
  described by `mp`. This routine is a subset of `tmxr_attach`.

- `t_stat tmxr_detach(TMXR *mp, UNIT *uptr)` – detach all connections
  for the terminals described by `mp` and unit `uptr`.

- `t_stat tmxr_close_master(TMXR *mp)` – close the master port for the
  terminals described by `mp`. This routine is a subset of
  `tmxr_detach`.

- `t_stat tmxr_ex(t_value *vptr, t_addr addr, UNIT *uptr, int32 sw)` –
  stub examine routine, needed because the extra terminals are marked
  as attached; always returns an error.

- `t_stat tmxr_dep(t_value val, t_addr addr, UNIT *uptr, int32 sw)` –
  stub deposit routine, needed because the extra terminals are marked
  as detached; always returns an error.

- `void tmxr_msg(SOCKET sock, const char *msg)` – output character
  string `msg` to socket sock.

- `void tmxr_linemsg(TMLN *lp, const char *msg)` – output character
  string `msg` to line `lp`.

- `void tmxr_linemsgf(TMLN *lp, const const *fmt, ...)` – output
  formatted `msg` to line `lp`.

- `void tmxr_fconns(FILE *st, TMLN *lp, int32 ln)` – output connection
  status to stream `st` for the line described by `lp`. If `ln >= 0`,
  preface the output with the specified line number.

- `void tmxr_fstats(FILE *st, TMLN *lp, int32 ln)` – output connection
  statistics to stream *st* for the line described by `lp`. If `ln >= 0`,
  preface the output with the specified line number.

- `t_stat tmxr_set_log(UNIT *uptr, int32 val, char *cptr, void *mp)` –
  enable logging of a line of the multipleser described by `mp` to the
  filename pointed to by `cptr`. If `uptr` is `NULL`, then `val` indicates
  the line number; otherwise, the unit number within the associated
  device implies the line number. This function may be used as an `MTAB`
  validation routine.

- `t_stat tmxr_set_nolog(UNIT *uptr, int32 val, const char *cptr,
  const void *mp)` – disable logging of a line of the multiplexer
  described by `mp` to the filename pointed to by `cptr`. If `uptr` is
  `NULL`, then `val` indicates the line number; otherwise, the unit
  number within the associated device implies the line number. This
  function may be used as an `MTAB` validation routine.

- `t_stat tmxr_show_log(FILE *st, UNIT *uptr, int32 val, const void
  *mp)` – outputs the logging status of a line of the multiplexer
  described by `mp` to stream `st`. If `uptr` is `NULL`, then `val`
  indicates the line number; otherwise, the unit number within the
  associated device implies the line number. This function may be used
  as an `MTAB` display routine.

- `t_stat tmxr_dscln(UNIT *uptr, int32 val, const char *cptr, const void *mp)` –
  parse the string pointed to by `cptr` for a decimal line number. If
  the line number is valid, disconnect the specified line in the
  terminal multiplexer described by `mp`. The calling sequence allows
  `tmxr_dscln` to be used as an `MTAB` processing routine. A line
  connected via a tcp session will be disconnected, a line connected
  to a serial port will be closed if the sim_switches `-C` flag is
  enabled when the routine is called, otherwise a serial port will
  have DTR dropped for 500ms and raised again.

- `t_stat tmxr_set_lnorder(UNIT *uptr, int32 val, const char *cptr,
  const void *desc)` – set the line connection order array associated
  with the `TMXR` structure pointed to by `desc`. The string pointed
  to by `cptr` is parsed for a semicolon-delimited list of
  ranges. Ranges are of the form:

| range          | interpretation                                      |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| `line1-line2`  | ascending sequence from `line1` to `line2`          |
| `line1/length` | ascending sequence from `line1` to `line1+length-1` |
| ALL | ascending sequence of all lines defined by the multiplexer |

The line order array must provide an int32 element for each line. The
calling sequence allows `tmxr_set_lnorder` to be used as an `MTAB`
processing routine.

- `t_stat tmxr_show_lnorder(FILE *st, UNIT *uptr, int32 val, void
  *desc) – output the line connection order associated multiplexer
  (TMXR *)` `desc` to stream `st`. The order is rendered as a
  semicolon-delimited list of ranges. The calling sequence allows
  `tmxr_show_lnorder` to be used as an `MTAB` processing routine.

- `t_stat tmxr_show_summ(FILE *st, UNIT *uptr, int32 val, const void
  *desc)` – outputs the summary status of the multiplexer `(TMXR *)
  desc` to stream `st`.

- `t_stat tmxr_show_cstat(FILE *st, UNIT *uptr, int32 val, const void
  *desc)` – outputs either the connections (`val = 1`) or the statistics
  (`val = 0`) of the multiplexer `(TMXR *) desc` to stream `st`. Also
  checks for multiplexer not attached, or all lines disconnected.

- `t_stat tmxr_show_lines(FILE *st, UNIT *uptr, int32 val, const void
  *desc)` – outputs the number of lines in the terminal multiplexer
  `(TMXR *)` I to stream I.

- `t_stat tmxr_set_modem_control_passthru(TMXR *mp)` – Enables modem
  control passthru behaviors, and disables internal manipulation of
  `DTR` (&`RTS`) by tmxr APIs. Enables the `tmxr_set_get_modem_bits` and
  `tmxr_set_config_line` APIs.

- `t_stat tmxr_clear_modem_control_passthru(TMXR *mp)` – Disables
  modem control passthru behaviors, and enables internal manipulation

  Declares that the device which interfaces the specified `TMXR` does
  not use the `tmxr_set_config_line` API to set the port line speed
  for the specified line. This declaration should only be necessary if
  `tmxr_set_port_speed_control` had been called previously. I will

  Declare which unit polls for input on a given line (only needed if
  the input polling unit is different than the unit provided when the
  multiplexer was attached.

The OS dependent serial I/O and socket routines should not be accessed
by the terminal simulators. The routines provided by sim_sock and
sim_serial are for internal use by the `TMXR` library only and should
be not be used directly by any simulator.

## Magnetic Tape Emulation Library

SIMH supports the use of emulated magnetic tapes. Magnetic tapes are
emulated as disk files containing both data records and metadata
markers; the format is fully described in the paper “SIMH Magtape
Representation and Handling”. SIMH provides a supporting library,
`sim_tape.c` (and its header file, `sim_tape.h`), that abstracts
handling of magnetic tapes. This allows support for multiple tape
formats, without change to magnetic device simulators.

The magtape library does not require any special data
structures. However, it does define some additional unit flags:

| name       | description          |
|------------|----------------------|
| `MTUF_WLK` | unit is write locked |

If magtape simulators need to define private unit flags, those flags
should begin at bit number `MTUF_V_UF` instead of `UNIT_V_UF`. The
magtape library maintains the current magtape position in the `pos`
field of the `UNIT` structure.

Library `sim_tape.c` provides the following routines to support
emulated magnetic tapes. These are declared in header file
`sim_tape.h`.

- `t_stat sim_tape_attach(UNIT *uptr, const char *cptr)` – Attach tape
  unit `uptr` to file `cptr`. Tape simulators must call this routine,
  rather than the standard `attach_unit` routine. This allows for
  future expansion of format support and proper functionality with all
  other tape APIs.

- `t_stat sim_tape_detach(UNIT *uptr)` – Detach tape unit `uptr` from
  its current file.

- `t_stat sim_tape_set_fmt(UNIT *uptr, int32 val, const char *cptr,
  void *desc)` – Set the tape format for unit `uptr` to the format

  void *desc)` – Write the tape format for unit `uptr` to the file
  specified by descriptor `st`.

  void *desc)` – Set the tape capacity for unit `uptr` to the
  capacity, in MB, specified by string `cptr`.

- `t_stat sim_tape_show_capac(FILE *st, UNIT *uptr, int32 val, const
  void *desc)` – Write the capacity for unit `uptr` to the file
  specified by descriptor `st`.

- `t_stat sim_tape_set_dens(UNIT *uptr, int32 val, const char *cptr,
  void *desc)` – Set the tape density for unit `uptr` to the density,
  in bits per inch, specified by string `cptr`. Only specific
  densities are supported; `desc` must point at an `int32` value
  consisting of one or more `MT_*_VALID` constants logically ORed
  together that specifies the densities allowed. Alternately, `desc`
  may be set to `NULL` and `val` may specify one of the `MT_DENS_*`
  constants to set the density directly; in this case, `cptr` is
  ignored.

- `t_stat sim_tape_show_dens(FILE *st, UNIT *uptr, int32 val, const
  void *desc)` – Write the density for unit `uptr` to the file
  specified by descriptor `st`.

- `t_stat sim_tape_rdrecf(UNIT *uptr, uint8 *buf, t_mtrlnt *tbc,

  `tbc`. Note that the record is returned in forward order, that is,
  byte 0 of the record is stored in buf[0], and so on.

- `t_stat sim_tape_rdrecr_a(UNIT *uptr, uint8 *buf, t_mtrlnt *tbc,
  t_mtrlnt max, TAPE_PCALLBACK callback)` – Reverse read the next
  record on unit `uptr` into buffer `buf` of size `max`. Return the
  actual record size in `tbc` and call callback routine on
  completion. Note that the record is returned in forward order, that

  number of bytes specified by `tbc`. If `tbc` is `0`, then the tape
  mark at the current position is erased. If the tape is not
  positioned at a record of the specified length or at a tape mark,
  the routine returns `MTSE_INVRL`.

- `t_stat sim_tape_errecr(UNIT *uptr, t_mtrlnt tbc)` – Starting at the
  current tape position, write an erase gap in the reverse direction
  on unit `uptr` for a length corresponding to a record containing the
  number of bytes specified by `tbc`. If `tbc` is `0`, then the tape
  mark preceding the current position is erased. If the tape is not
  positioned at the end of a record of the specified length or at a
  tape mark, the routine returns `MTSE_INVRL`.

- `t_stat sim_tape_sprecf(UNIT *uptr, t_mtrlnt *tbc)` – Space unit

   write-protected.

- `t_bool sim_tape_eot(UNIT *uptr)` – Return `TRUE` if unit `uptr` has
  exceeded the capacity specified for the unit (kept in
  uptr-\>capac).

The library supports reading and writing erase gaps in standard (SIMH)
tape format image files. Before writing a gap with `sim_tape_wrgap`,
the tape unit density must be set by calling `sim_tape_set_dens`;
failure to do so will result in an error. For reading, if the tape
density has been set, then the length is monitored when skipping over
erase gaps. If the gap length reaches 25 feet (the maximum allowed by
the ANSI/ECMA standards), motion is terminated, and “tape runaway”
status is returned. Runaway status is also returned if an
end-of-medium marker or the physical end of file is encountered while
spacing over a gap. If the density has not been set, then a gap of any
length is skipped, and tape runaway status is never returned; in
effect, any erase gaps present in the tape image file will be
transparent to the calling simulator.

The library supports writing erase gaps over existing data records and
writing records over existing gaps. If the end of a gap overlays part
of a data record, the record will be truncated, but the tape image
will remain valid.

An attempt to write an erase gap in an unsupported tape format results
in no action and no error. This allows a device simulator that
supports writing erase gaps to call `sim_tape_wrgap` without concern
for the tape format currently selected by the user.

`sim_tape_attach`, `sim_tape_detach`, `sim_tape_set_fmt`,
`sim_tape_show_fmt`, `sim_tape_set_capac`, `sim_tape_show_capac`,
`sim_tape_set_dens`, and `sim_tape_show_dens` return standard SCP
status codes; the other magtape library routines return private
codes for success and failure. The currently defined magtape status
codes are:

| name           | description                                            |
|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------|

| `MTSE_UNATT`   | unit is not attached to a file                         |
| `MTSE_FMT`     | unit specifies an unsupported tape file format         |

| `MTSE_RUNAWAY` | tape runaway occurred                                  |

`sim_tape_set_fmt`, `sim_tape_show_fmt`, `sim_tape_set_capac`, and
`sim_tape_show_capac` should be referenced by an entry in the tape
device’s modifier list, as follows:

```c
MTAB tape_mod[] = {
    { MTAB_XTD|MTAB_VDV, 0, "FORMAT", "FORMAT",
      &sim_tape_set_fmt, &sim_tape_show_fmt, NULL },
    { MTAB_XTD|MTAB_VUN, 0, "CAPACITY", "CAPACITY",
      &sim_tape_set_capac, &sim_tape_show_capac, NULL },
  /* ... */
};
```

`sim_tape_set_dens` and `sim_tape_show_dens` may be referenced in the
modifier list, or `sim_tape_set_dens` may be called directly to set
the density, as indicated above.

## Disk Emulation Library

SIMH supports the use of disk drives. Disk drives as disk files
containing both data and potentially additional metadata which
describes various aspects of the disk container and the disk drive it
emulates. SIMH provides a supporting library, `sim_disk.c` (and its
header file, `sim_disk.h`), that abstracts handling of disk drives
which have sectors which are a multiple of 512 bytes. This allows
support for alternate disk formats or disk access to physical devices
on the host system, without change to disk device simulators.

The disk library does not require any special data structures.

If disk drive simulators need to define private unit flags, those
flags should begin at bit number `DKUF_V_UF` instead of
`UNIT_V_UF`. The disk library maintains the current disk position in
the `pos` field of the `UNIT` structure.

Library `sim_disk.c` provides the following routines to support
emulated disk drives. These are declared in include file `sim_disk.h`.

- `t_stat sim_disk_attach(UNIT *uptr, const char *cptr, size_t
  sector_size, size_t xfer_element_size, t_bool dontautosize, uint32
  debugbit, const char *drivetype, uint32 pdp11_tracksize, int
  completion_delay)` – Attach disk unit `uptr` to file `cptr`. Disk

  completion_delay, const char **drivetypes)` – Attach disk unit
  `uptr` to file `cptr`. Disk simulators should call this routine,
  rather than the standard attach_unit routine, The `drivetypes` is a
  `NULL` terminated list of drive types available to autosize.

- `t_stat sim_disk_attach_ex2(UNIT *uptr, const char *cptr, size_t
  sector_size, size_t xfer_element_size, t_bool dontchangecapac,
  uint32 debugbit, const char *drivetype, uint32 pdp11_tracksize, int
  completion_delay, const char **drivetypes, size_t reserved_sectors)`
  – Attach disk unit `uptr` to file `cptr`. Disk simulators should

  `TRUE` if so.

- `t_bool sim_disk_wrp(UNIT *uptr)` – Return `TRUE` if unit `uptr` is

`sim_disk_attach`, `sim_disk_detach`, `sim_disk_set_fmt`,
`sim_disk_show_fmt`, `sim_disk_set_capac`, and `sim_tape_disk_capac`
return standard SCP status codes; the other disk library routines
return private codes for success and failure. Success status is
`DKSE_OK` and any other value is an error. ``errno` usually will have
the appropriate error code:

| name      | description          |
|-----------|----------------------|
| `DKSE_OK` | operation successful |

`sim_disk_set_fmt`, `sim_disk_show_fmt`, `sim_disk_set_capac`, and
`sim_disk_show_capac` should be referenced by an entry in the disk
device’s modifier list, as follows:

```c
MTAB disk_mod[] = {
    { MTAB_XTD\|MTAB_VDV, 0, "FORMAT", "FORMAT",
      &sim_disk_set_fmt, &sim_disk_show_fmt, NULL },
    { MTAB_XTD\|MTAB_VUN, 0, "CAPACITY", "CAPACITY",
      &sim_disk_set_capac, &sim_disk_show_capac, NULL },
  /* ... */
};
```

## Breakpoint Support

SIMH provides a highly flexible and extensible breakpoint subsystem to
assist in debugging simulated code. Its features include:

- Up to 26 different kinds of breakpoints (\*)
- Unlimited numbers of breakpoints
- Proceed counts for each breakpoint
- Automatic execution of commands when a breakpoint is taken

If debugging is going to be a major activity on a simulator,
implementation of a full-featured breakpoint facility will be of
immense help to users.

\[\* Breakpoint type C should probably be avoided since the -C switch
is used by the “SHOW BREAK -C” command to display currently defined
breakpoints as commands which can be entered in a subsequent
invocation of the simulator to recreate the same breakpoint set.\]

### Breakpoint Basics

SIMH breakpoints are characterized by a type, an address, a class, a
proceed count, and an action string. Breakpoint types are arbitrary
and are defined by the virtual machine. Each breakpoint type is
assigned a unique letter. All simulators to date provide execution
(“E”) breakpoints. A useful extension would be to provide breakpoints
on read (“R”) and write (“W”) data access. Even finer gradations are
possible, e.g., physical versus virtual addressing, DMA versus CPU
access, and so on.

Breakpoints can be assigned to devices other than the CPU, but
breakpoints don’t contain a device pointer. Thus, each device must
have its own unique set of breakpoint types. For example, if a
simulator contained a programmable graphics processor, it would need a
separate instruction breakpoint type (e.g., type G rather than E).

The virtual machine defines the valid breakpoint types to SIMH through
two variables:

- `sim_brk_types` – initialized by the VM (usually in the CPU reset
  routine) to a mask of all supported breakpoints; bit 0 (low order
  bit) corresponds to type ‘A’, bit 1 to type ‘B’, etc.

- `sim_brk_dflt` – initialized by the VM to the mask for the default
  breakpoint type.

SIMH in turn provides the virtual machine with a summary of all the
breakpoint types that currently have active breakpoints:

- `sim_brk_summ` – maintained by SIMH; provides a bit mask summary of
  whether any breakpoints of a particular type have been defined.

When the virtual machine reaches the point in its execution cycle
corresponding to a breakpoint type, it tests to see if any breakpoints
of that type are active. If so, it calls `sim_brk_test` to see if a
breakpoint of a specified type (or types) is set at the current
address. Here is an example from the fetch phase, testing for an
execution breakpoint:

```c
/* Test for breakpoint before fetching next instruction */

if ((sim_brk_summ & SWMASK ('E')) &&
     sim_brk_test (PC, SWMASK ('E'))) /* execution break */
```

If the virtual machine implements only one kind of breakpoint, then
testing `sim_brk_summ` for non-zero suffices. Even if there are multiple
breakpoint types, a simple non-zero test distinguishes the
no-breakpoints case (normal run mode) from debugging mode and provides
sufficient efficiency.

When a breakpoint match is detected by `sim_brk_test` the global
variables `sim_brk_match_type` and `sim_brk_match_addr` are set to
reflect the details of the match that was found. Simulator code can
use this information directly or SIMH provides internal facilities to
report the details of breakpoints which have been matched. For
example:

```c
BRKTYPTAB cpu_breakpoints [] = {
    BRKTYPE('E',"Execute Instruction at Virtual Address"),
    BRKTYPE('P',"Execute Instruction at Physical Address"),
    BRKTYPE('R',"Read from Virtual Address"),
    BRKTYPE('S',"Read from Physical Address"),
    BRKTYPE('W',"Write to Virtual Address"),
    BRKTYPE('X',"Write to Physical Address"),
    { 0 }
};

t_stat cpu_reset (DEVICE *dptr)
{
  /* ... */
    sim_brk_dflt = SWMASK ('E');
    sim_brk_types = sim_brk_dflt|SWMASK ('P')|
    SWMASK ('R')|SWMASK ('S')|
    SWMASK ('W')|SWMASK ('X');
    sim_brk_type_desc = cpu_breakpoints;
  /* ... */
}
```

In the breakpoint dispatch code something like:

```c
reason = STOP_IBKPT;
sim_messagef (reason, "%s", sim_brk_message());
/*[and then sim_instr() returns with]:*/
return reason;
```

Or, if it is desirable to suppress the standard message produced when
returning to SCP, the following may be used:

```c
reason = STOP_IBKPT;
reason = sim_messagef (reason, "%s\n", sim_brk_message());
/*[and then sim_instr() returns with:]*/
return reason;
```

`sim_messagef` produces a message which contains either the breakpoint
type and the matched breakpoint address (if `sim_brk_type_desc` is not
set), or the type mapped to it related description as indicated in the
`BRKTYPTAB` pointed to by `sim_brk_typ_desc`.

### Testing For Breakpoints

Breakpoint testing must be done at every point in the instruction
decode and execution cycle where an event relating to a breakpoint
type occurs. If a virtual machine implements data breakpoints, it
simplifies implementation if data reads and writes are centralized in
subroutines, rather than scattered throughout the code. For this
reason (among others), it is good practice to perform memory access
through subroutines, rather than by direct access to the memory array.

As an example, consider a virtual machine with a central memory read
subroutine. This routine takes an additional parameter, the type of
read (often required for memory protection):

```c
#define IF    0    /* fetch */
#define ID    1    /* indirect */
#define RD    2    /* data read */
#define WR    3    /* data write */

t_stat Read (uint32 addr, uint32 *dat, uint32 acctyp)
{
    static uint32 bkpt_type[4] = {
        SWMASK('E'), SWMASK('N'),
        SWMASK('R'), SWMASK('W')
    };

    if ((sim_brk_summ & bkpt_type[acctyp]) &&
         sim_brk_test (addr, bkpt_type[acctyp]))
        return STOP_BKPT;
    else
        *dat = M[addr];

    return SCPE_OK;
}
```

This routine provides differentiated breakpoints for execution,
indirect addresses, and data reads, with a single test.

### The Replay Problem

When a breakpoint is taken, control returns to the SIMH control
package. Depending on the code structure of the simulated system and
the particular type of breakpoint, a breakpoint may be taken before or
after a specific activity has completed. If it is taken before the
operation has actually been performed, when execution resumes, the
same breakpoint will be reached and taken again immediately. This
could result in an endless loop, with the simulator never progressing
beyond a breakpoint.

To address this problem, when a breakpoint is taken, SIMH remembers
the breakpoint that was taken and the instruction executed count when
that particular breakpoint was taken. If the next breakpoint test for
that breakpoint type is to the same address and the instruction
execution count is the same, SIMH suppresses the breakpoint. Thus, the
simulator can make progress past the breakpoint but will take the
breakpoint again if control returns to the same address.

In order to properly suppress replay breakpoints it is important that
the bookkeeping that a simulator does to record the instructions
actually executed not be done when a breakpoint is taken. This
bookkeeping is done by adjustments to `sim_interval` and subsequent
calls to `sim_process_event`. If a simulator returns from `sim_instr()`
due to a breakpoint either the adjustment to `sim_interval` should be
done after all breakpoint checking or the return logic that handles
breakpoints should unwind any `sim_interval` adjustment that may have
happened.

Most simulators will implement a CPU execution breakpoint concept such
that the breakpoint is taken prior to the instruction at the
breakpoint address having executed. This allows for the user to
continue execution from breakpoint and the simulator will produce
precisely the same results as if the breakpoint hadn’t been there. In
order for this to be true, when a breakpoint is taken, not only must
`sim_interval` be restored to its value prior to the breakpoint, but
all other simulator specific state must also be retained. This state
includes program counter, the contents of registers, condition codes
and memory that may have already changed prior to the call to
`sim_brk_test` that causes the breakpoint to be taken. Achieving this
is simplest with basic PC based execution breakpoints and gets more
complicated with breakpoints based on various memory reference
activities.

### Breakpoint Classes

SIMH implements up to 8 breakpoint classes. Each breakpoint class has
its own state. Thus, if the E, R, and W breakpoints are assigned to
separate classes, each will be suppressed in turn until the next
breakpoint test on that class that fails or that uses a different
address.

Breakpoint classes are arbitrary identifiers and can be assigned by
the simulator writer as desired. The class is specified as part of the
breakpoint type in the call to `sim_brk_test`:

- `<31:29>` = class number (0 by default)
- `<25:0>` = bit mask of breakpoint types

Note that breakpoint classes and breakpoint types are
orthogonal. Thus, classes can be used to distinguish different cases
of the same breakpoint type. For example, in an SMP system with ‘n’
processors, classes 0..n-1 could be used for E-breakpoints for
processors 0..n-1. Or in a VAX, classes 1..6 could be used for data
breakpoints on operands 1..6, with 0 reserved for the CPU’s
E-breakpoints.
